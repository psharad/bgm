We are not experts, but we\'ve grown wise the good old fashioned way: by dating. Lots.&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Dating in New York City at times seems like having access to a 24/7 all-you-can-eat buffet. Spoiler alert: your eyes are bigger than your stomach. The endless variety dictates that when your options are so many, you can never bring yourself to make a single one. The hipster looks good (when he showers), the investment banker is a real crowd pleaser, and of course, of-age students are always fun. You end up wanting them all, yet we venture to guess, considering you&rsquo;re reading a dating blog, you come away with none. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">We like to hook people up, introduce friends of friends, and spark romances; we are your best wingman. But we&rsquo;ve never had much luck as our own. And that&rsquo;s the problem. Surrounded by millions of possible Mr./Ms. Right&rsquo;s, over-stimulated (not in a good way), and admittedly, a little lonely, maybe it&rsquo;s time to get out of our heads and go to bed. New York doesn&rsquo;t sleep, and New Yorkers shouldn&rsquo;t sleep with anyone other than whomever they want. But because you&rsquo;ve probably been doing that for weeks, months, possibly years, instead of thinking it&rsquo;s the dating scene that&rsquo;s the problem, maybe it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;whomever they want&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the problem. We\'re not prudish, and casual sex is a dish best served piping hot, but we\'re starting to think that it&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s going on between the sheets but what&rsquo;s going on in between my ears that is tripping a lot of us up. We have so many amazing choices at our disposal, yet oftentimes we drag our feet over the menu items we don&rsquo;t actually want to eat (pun slightly intended). </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">That hipster looks good when he showers, but he doesn&rsquo;t really shower that much. That investment banker is kind of a douche&hellip;and bad in bed. And that student is more than a little immature: how many times can you play beer pong until it all gets old? </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Are there more \"Specials\" to choose from on the Love Menu?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Common sense states that anything worth having is going to be a lot of work. Sage: if someone is worth the effort, we gladly roll up our proverbial sleeves and put our backs into it. But somewhere along the line, a lot of us forgot the difference between work that defines us and work that destroys us. We aim to never work in the latter sense a single day of our lives. When something is easy&mdash;because it&rsquo;s right&mdash; it feels serendipitous, whimsical, and even, ahem, romantic. We&rsquo;re New Yorkers, and we work every single day of our lives. We work for respect, cabs, promotions, seats on the subway, personal space, reservations, connections, barstools...it&rsquo;s exhausting. Why work for Mr./Ms. Wrong? Maybe we\'re naive, but we hold on to the faith that love is supposed to be free. And all we have to do is find the person who isn&rsquo;t going to charge us for it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Having choice isn&rsquo;t a problem, it&rsquo;s awesome. But it might be time to start being honest with ourselves: Has the New York &ldquo;sell yourself&rdquo; mentality rubbed off on you to the point where dates play out more like business meetings and the result is a second date with a person who is paper perfect but not necessarily spectacular? Things that seem complicated have a funny way of being really simple. We are all looking for that person that fits comfortably. Like a perfectly broken in pair of rainbow flip flops, those jeans that make your ass look amazing, or even that pair of &ldquo;do me&rdquo; underwear that never fail to impress even the most jaded, disillusioned of lovers. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Keep working. Just make sure you&rsquo;re working for something and someone you actually want who\'s working just as hard for you. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Tales From The Date</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: \'trebuchet ms\', geneva; font-size: medium;\"><br /></span></p>','cs_logo.png','image/png',26545,'2011-10-18 22:16:05'),(6,'music','music@connectingsexes.com','b7eb5279c21e23d0bfcddf3d598a47e56dfe0951da0bcb6f73a9776ff58288343079d10e097b7ccc4a17704d0577648aa515c6a290f0458cc55c2bd3948c3dbd','UT8sYsuTG1UIQlp4ot','01ddd25ec863ef1630ce36db733633880f3c886791fed1a1cf4fe6da3d58f1090e89f468773e99b0815c6dcf2e620c8e0c2cf459c42f144b713db2ab1301d598','2011-10-18 21:27:51','2011-12-25 23:46:39',1,'Music',NULL,'<p>Music makes any day better.

Paul goes back and fourth in a seemingly idiotic fashion, further confusing his already bewildered student. Don&rsquo;t try to surf, Jason, don&rsquo;t do it; the less you do, the more you <em>do</em>. The funniest part of that scene, ironically enough, is that&rsquo;s actually solid advice. One can learn a lot about dating and relationships from surfing. In the world of dating it seems that the less you try and force a relationship with someone the more they seem to want one with you. I&rsquo;ll spare the masses the &ldquo;we want what we can&rsquo;t have&rdquo; diatribe; we all know this to be very true. But rather the more you let your instincts drive your involvement with your potential partner(s), the more organically &ndash;and therefore fruitfully- the relationship grows. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">However, there is a distinct difference between doing &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; and just straight-up doing nothing.

These are major investments I&rsquo;m applying towards someone who I &ndash;admittedly- don&rsquo;t know very well&hellip; not to mention this is a recession. The more investments you make, the more invested you become and the less opportunity you give the other person to invest in you. Let your natural instincts determine the appropriate time to hit certain relationship milestones. Acting prematurely is an expression of insecurity so remember that premature equals immature, and immature equals replaceable.

It\'s no wonder most of us <a href=\"http://www.fitsugar.com/4117944\">gain some weight</a> when going off to college, though the infamous \"freshman 15\" is <a href=\"http://www.fitsugar.com/3619387\">really more like 10 pounds</a>. And don\'t be fooled &mdash; weight gain isn\'t reserved to first-year students only.

Google won&rsquo;t be getting this + 1 anytime soon (however, anyone is free to send me an invite if they so choose). But treat Facebook like a casual hookup. Use it, enjoy it, but respect it&rsquo;s potential for drama and always leave a little mystery. I&rsquo;ve found that Facebook -amazing as it is- not only has the capacity to bring out our inner creeper but it also has a tendency to make people feel unnecessarily shitty about themselves. We are force-fed our &ldquo;friends&rdquo; triumphs and their every happy moments are chronicled on our newsfeeds, leading a lot of us to believe that our lives are boring and therefore empty and meaningless. Your life is only boring and meaningless if you&rsquo;re always on Facebook. Go out and explore NYC, meet actual friends, make some real stories&hellip; and try not to make every interesting observation a status update (guilty). And for the love of God, only stalk when absolutely necessary.

While it is true that dates are for letting loose and getting to know someone a little better and apologies should never be made for getting ones drink on, this guy wasn&rsquo;t date drunk he was frat boy drunk. Not to mention he looked me dead in the eye and asked point blank if he was going to get laid that night seeing as this was the second time he&rsquo;d taken me out (wow&hellip; I mean, just wow). </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">What happened after involved some shattered expectations (on his end), a lot of bickering and ultimately an extremely awkward cab ride in which there were two stops&hellip; not one.

So I suppose the moral of this story is one for the guys: If she likes you, she knows she&rsquo;s going to bed you about 60 seconds after she meets you. There should be zero need for negotiation. It could happen after one date, after five&hellip; But please, for the sake of humanity don&rsquo;t ask. When it comes to sex, your mantra should NOT be &ldquo;ask and you shall receive&rdquo;.

The menu was characterized by a heavy seafood persuasion and a Corona was a perfectly acceptable beverage of choice. If you know me at all it should come as no surprise that he basically nailed it -in more ways than one.

But I don&rsquo;t think the disconnect is as prolific as its made out to be. In truth, if you guys had to be honest I suspect you know deep down when a female actually thinks of you as a friend or as a friend with whom she wants to engage in some benefits. And I have found that a vast, concerning number of men tend to ignore this and proceed under the misguided belief that they can change her mind through &ndash;at times trivial- pursuit.

So yeah, I want to wear clothing that accentuates, not exploits, my assets. All persons should be encouraged to dress in a way that makes them feel sexy&hellip; I mean, why the hell wouldn&rsquo;t we? And what I&rsquo;ve never understood about guys who claim that a certain dress sense translates to DTF* is that the longer you allow yourselves to keep making this administrative error, the less likely women will continue to want to dress themselves in a way that is both visually and physically stimulating for you. Continue to make us feel uncomfortable, misunderstood and slutty and we&rsquo;ll soon begin to rock skirts inspired by the Church of Latter Day Saints, which hit us just below our tightly locked knees.

How brave of him, I figured, to trust me enough to open up and express his deepest, darkest sexual desires (update: the secretary fetish was by no means as deep and dark as his desires went... I have a closet full of skeletons in the form of adult costumes for which he is entirely to blame). So I donned a skintight pencil skirt, blue button-up that was largely un-buttoned and my most corporate looking of hooker heels. I took his calls, organized his file cabinet and </span><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">gave him the ride of his life&nbsp; -if I may say so myself- </span><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">atop his IKEA dorm-room desk. Who knew bringing someone their coffee could bring them to orgasm? I aim to please&hellip; that&rsquo;s just how I get down. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">Like any boyfriend should he asked me what one of my sexual fantasies was, to which I answered with what I reasoned to be a more-or-less&nbsp; commonplace response: I have a rape fantasy. He was taken aback but I was&nbsp; eventually taken against my will&hellip; exactly how I wanted it. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">A large number of men are surprised to hear that the rape scenario ranks #1 on the list of top female sexual fantasies. It&rsquo;s one of the bandwagons I&rsquo;ll get on, but only because its one of the bandwagons that gets me off. <strong>Women don&rsquo;t actually want to be raped, let me make that clear.</strong> It&rsquo;s more a deep-rooted, inherently animalistic urge to be dominated by a man. In a society overtaken by the metro-sexual, over-sensitive type male, many women just want men to be men (ladies: if the aforementioned is your type, we&rsquo;re just going to have to agree to disagree). And there is no greater display of masculinity than being taken -from behind or just in general- ravaged, and used entirely for our partner&rsquo;s pleasure. It&rsquo;s hot. Like, religious experience hot. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">We know you&rsquo;re not <em>actually</em> raping us (hopefully) and it&rsquo;s simply blissful to imagine that we\'re so irresistibly sexy that you simply will not take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer. You don&rsquo;t have to rough her up and make it hurt per se (don&rsquo;t knock it till you try it), or go to any severe theatrical lengths, but there are definitely a few maneuvers that can be of great help in this particular situation. Namely: pin her arms behind her head, throw her into positions, pull her hair, grab her throat (gently), smack her ass, tell her that her pussy belongs to you&hellip; Seriously, just use your imagination. But think more along the lines of Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas in <em>Original Sin</em> and less Jodie Foster in <em>The Accused</em>. Sex is supposed to be fun and since rape fantasies are still slightly taboo, I&rsquo;d imagine that there is ample room here for misunderstanding. Communication, as always, seems to be key. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">Now go fourth and conquer&hellip; her. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\"><strong>*</strong> I am referring to lovemaking </span><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">(or whatever you want to call it)</span><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\"> between consenting adults.

Rape is an egregious crime and I truly believe that the vast majority of women <em>and</em> men agree with me, 110%.

Not to mention the fact that while many New Yorkers are now chilling out because its no longer &ldquo;beach season&rdquo;, surfers state-wide are amping up their workouts because unfortunately the only season less forgiving than that of &ldquo;beach&rdquo; is that of &ldquo;wet-suit&rdquo;: sucks some major d. So, in an attempt to up my endorphins and down my suit size I made the decision to get my increasingly fatter ass back at it. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Day 1: October 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2011<br /></span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">I was immediately reminded why I stopped getting my gym on. I&rsquo;ll elaborate&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">The gym I attend is sketchy, doesn&rsquo;t have any classes, and is full of both guidos and law students: an undoubtedly interesting mix. However, the membership fee is a whopping $100 per year. Yes, you read that correctly. And yes, at Planet Fitness you get what you pay for. There are certainly some limitations that come with paying less per annum than my nightly bar tab&hellip; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Shorts, tank tops, or any article of clothing whatsoever that shows any trace, vague or otherwise, of tit/ass is a no go. EVERY. SINGLE. GUY will stare. Gawk actually. And it&rsquo;s incredibly uncomfortable. I once made the colossal mistake of wearing a baby tee (I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t July and oppressively hot or anything) and a middle-aged married man with more gunt* than Rosanne Barr stared so unapologetically I was forced to actually verbally communicate my discomfort to my fellow exerciser: awkward to say the least. I mean, take a moment to enjoy the view but go ahead and move on with your life after a few short seconds, Mr. old enough to be my father. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Additionally, the guido &ldquo;juice heads&rdquo; who are straight out of MTV&rsquo;s <em>Jersey Shore</em> jump on all of the machines like they\'re a roofied chick in Seaside and don&rsquo;t let anyone else get in on the cardiovascular action, even for a quick set (God forbid their GTL is inconvenienced in any way). I either have to go at 10 am with all the MILF&rsquo;s or 10 pm with all the losers that have nothing better to do if I want to get any kind of workout in. I&rsquo;m not a morning person and I have a partying habit to maintain so this means I don&rsquo;t have many windows of workout opportunities. Oh white people problems, how I hate thee&hellip; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">However, I will admit that simply lacing up my running shoes and setting foot in the gym after so long felt uplifiting -although slightly intimidating. So let\'s just ignore the fact that my treadmill performance was less than stellar but hey, at least I didn\'t pull a bitch move and get on the elliptical. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">A good way to get in a rut of any sort is to become inactive. My goal is to find some sort of balance so as to once and for all end this pattern of extremes that I see in my own workout habits and those of many people I know. The only way to go about fitness in general -whether it be exercise, diet or both- is to develop routines that are reasonable and can be maintained over the long term. Only then will fitness and health be an integral part of ones life and ultimately lead to a general sense of contentment- both internal and external. <br /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">So for now I&rsquo;m just going to have to accept the uncomfortable stares, relentless guidos, and awkward call times as inalienable truths of my current fitness reality.

Typically, it isn&rsquo;t difficult to convince the man in your life to comply (if it is, you have bigger problems and I can&rsquo;t help you), but fall means just about every professional sport is in season. Translation: damn near seven nights a week something -whether it be hockey, playoff baseball, football, or American football- seems to garner the already short attention span of the dudes (and some of the girls that try too hard to be one of the &ldquo;guys&rdquo;&hellip; guilty). But the power of the pussy can overcome the most difficult of obstacles. Even, dare I say, that of Sports Center or ESPN. However, the fall sports deluge presents itself as a worthy adversary to say the least, so if your horniness is off The Richter Magnitude Scale, you&rsquo;ll need to proceed with </span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">merciless premeditation</span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"> and the utmost stealth. But he&rsquo;ll appreciate it in the end so there&rsquo;s no need to feel bad in the slightest. He&rsquo;s getting laid, he&rsquo;ll get over missing part of his precious game. That&rsquo;s what SC highlights are for&hellip; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">First and foremost, make sure to get him early on before he&rsquo;s consumed too many hot wings and/or beer. This is for the safety of all parties involved. If he&rsquo;s full of that shit guys eat (which is, incidentally, absolutely delicious), he&rsquo;ll not only feel sluggish and unsexy, but he&rsquo;ll actually <em>be</em> sluggish and unsexy. Perhaps consider bringing him his first beer with a side of blowjob? The game will have just started (who really cares at that point?) and it&rsquo;s a blowjob&hellip; with a beer. If he&rsquo;s resistant he likes d**k. That&rsquo;s just a fact. Side note: If his friends are over and you&rsquo;re not in the mood for an Eiffel Tower, or any other degrading sexual act involving multiple dude parts, you&rsquo;re going to have to either a) start without him or b) wait in anticipation&hellip; I&rsquo;d recommend doing both. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Secondly, the game is on. So he&rsquo;ll be distracted regardless &ndash; even if you&rsquo;re the stunt double of Adriana Lima (If you are, screw you). So stick to positions that allow him prime viewing pleasure&hellip; of both you and the game. Basically, have him sit on the couch and get on top or figure out some kind of from behind configuration. Men aren&rsquo;t known for their multi-tasking but they&rsquo;ll pleasantly -and pleasurably- surprise you in this particular scenario.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">And third, don&rsquo;t expect any kind of cuddling /attention afterward. Did I mention the game is on? As a woman I&rsquo;m going to level with you: you&rsquo;re asking too much if you expect that in this situation. Let me reiterate: THE GAME IS ON. He&rsquo;s so busy playing couch quarterback you&rsquo;re lucky he even got hard. Remember all those times you forced him to watch some bullshit on the E channel and then faked a headache so as to avoid sex afterward? Yeah, well karma is a bitch... and apparently so are you. Who fake&rsquo;s a headache anymore, honestly? Just say you&rsquo;re on your period (again) like a normal person. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Tis the season but you can still be taken to the ball game. However, it&rsquo;ll likely be a three-strikes and you&rsquo;re out kind of deal. A man distracted isn&rsquo;t going to be a marathoner in the sack.

But it can be intoxicating. Emotions are extreme, good music seems as though it was authored just for you and the artist within makes a cameo appearance. But anyone brave enough to have loved and cursed enough to have lost knows that the overwhelming unease and inner turmoil that accompanies such a loss is akin to serving hard time in a mental prison. I&rsquo;ve fallen in love twice, fallen out of love once, and I&rsquo;m single&hellip;&nbsp; you do the math. I&rsquo;m serving what seems like a life sentence, the crime for which I am now a repeat offender. But with my (generally) good behavior and prison overcrowding I&rsquo;m confident that I&rsquo;ll be paroled any day now.&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">The first time I fell in love I was in college. It was as if something inside of me recognized him although we were complete strangers: like I knew, before I could have possibly known, that he was going to play a significant role in my life. I let intuition be my guide and it lead me into the lions den. And I thank God that it did. Although we&rsquo;re no longer together, he bore witness to some of the most important years of my life and I did the same for him. How, then, could I ever regret him? Despite the fighting, tears and depleted self-esteem I know first-hand what it feels like to love someone more than I love myself and am, therefore, a better person as a result. It was only when I came to these realizations that I was able to repair after the demise of our relationship. No matter how much I hated him or how many other men I pursued -aimlessly and with reckless abandon- out of revenge, nothing laid my mind to rest quite like submitting to the belief that there was no way to know what life would have been like had I not met him but that, for all I knew, it could have been worse. So I resigned my memories of him, and of us, to my proverbial back pocket and moved on with my life. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">And now the present: the second attempt at love and ultimate exercise in loss. Little in life is certain but that my mastery of the English language</span><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\"> will fall short of a thorough and sufficiently eloquent expression of</span> <span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"> how I felt the first time I came across this person. I was intrigued, awestruck, and unequivocally disarmed: I was like Alice before the hole. Again, just as before, was this recognition of something otherworldly: something worth derailment. For him I experienced the entire spectrum of human emotion: lust, longing, love, loathing&hellip; and everything in between. Temporary insanity ensued after things ended and still persists now (in smaller measure) as I rebuild, but I can&rsquo;t help but be eternally grateful to know that I still have the propensity -and the ability- to feel with such ardor and conviction. I&rsquo;m single, I&rsquo;m imperfect, but I&rsquo;m brave.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">I highly recommend falling in love as many times, and with as much intensity, as you can. Go down that rabbit hole because what is the purpose of such a capacity for human emotion if you&rsquo;re not going to use it? Falling in love is often times wrought with pain and characterized by a loss of control that is nothing short of maddening. But the potential payoff is immense beyond the wildest of imaginations&hellip; Not to mention <strong>sex is even <em>more</em> orgasmic if you&rsquo;re in love with the person</strong>.

Trust me, I know. Even if the involvement left a lot to be desired, just the loss of a regular supply of sex is mourn worthy. And then it happens: by way of word of mouth, Facebook stalking, or, worst of all, an in person run-in, you discover that not only has your former flame moved on but they&rsquo;ve found a shinier model with which to replace you. Ouch baby, very ouch. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">If you happen to find out that you&rsquo;ve been substituted with someone better looking, you really only have two options for how to deal: you could either take it as further evidence that you&rsquo;re unattractive and unworthy of love or you can see it as a positive. For the record, I&rsquo;m a fan of the latter. If you allow some footnote on your relationship history to convince you of your own inferiority and lack of appeal, you&rsquo;re weak minded, self-deprecating and your issues were likely the cause for why things ended. However, seeing it as a positive thing, while seemingly impossible, can be an all-important step in the process of moving on. Allow me to explain&hellip; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">The fact that your ex (insert arbitrary title) has found someone more attractive means that you were in good (looking) company: by the way, your stand-ins so-called superiority in the looks department should be corroborated by at least one other non-biased individual, as your judgment is likely clouded at this time and this could all be much ado about nothing. But for arguments sake lets say they&rsquo;re hotter. Basically, this indicates that your past-tense lover maintained a certain standard level. This is a good thing. Congratulations: even if only for a short period of time you too were considered to be of sufficient caliber. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Additionally, be honest&hellip; if they left you for someone less attractive you must have been <em>that</em> bad.&nbsp; Humans are superficial beings, all looking for the next best thing so leaving one for a prettier other is logical to a certain extent. But switching things up for someone less attractive means that you were so unbearable that they would rather drop a hero and be with the zero. That indicates an extreme level of crazy and/or lack of quality on your part. Not exactly the &ldquo;accomplishment&rdquo; you should be aiming for. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">This particular situation is less than preferable, whichever way you choose to look at it. But it makes sense and you&rsquo;d probably do the same thing. So, in a way, you really can&rsquo;t blame them. Don&rsquo;t get mad, get even&hellip; hotter. See it as a challenge to better yourself. And remember how your ex was insecure about xyz? Well, go find someone who is solid in those departments, stage another run-in and cut them back down to size.

We&rsquo;re young and it&rsquo;s ok to look it&hellip; there&rsquo;s going to plenty of time to dress &ldquo;your age&rdquo; in the future, trust me.

The &ldquo;sweater over t-shirt&rdquo; look is not only fail-proof but pragmatic as well. One can adjust the outfit to the given temperature and still show off those God-given man muscles. Like with jeans, shirts and sweaters should be tight-<em>ish</em>, but we shouldn&rsquo;t be able to see every outline of your six-pack (or fat pack, should that be the case). When you leave a little to the imagination it allows our minds to wander and our eyes to undress you. &nbsp;Again&hellip; winning.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Mr. October is college-aged, exotic and lives in downtown NYC.

I\'ve lived in five countries and I speak 3.5 languages (none of which I speak well, however... including English). I received my fancy, over-priced and, as it turns out, futile Bachelors degree from NYU (for the record, I LOVED NYU and it actually deserves the designation as one of the nations best schools... but not for the reasons you\'d think). I tried the whole law school thing. As it turns out, it\'s just not for me. I surf, scour the world for underground music and hang out with a lot of dudes. Likes include -but are not limited to- (older) men with the light eye/dark hair combo (dimples are a MAJOR weakness of mine as well), sitting in bars alone and NHL hockey. Dislikes include Crocs, xenophobia and Nickelback. I strongly believe in God, the superiority of European beer and that soccer should actually be called football. As far as my personal life goes, I&rsquo;m still searching. For what exactly I&rsquo;m not quite sure but I&rsquo;m confident that I&rsquo;ll know it when I see it. Who am I, you might ask, to give advice? Well, my simultaneous fear of and desire for commitment has ensured that I&rsquo;ve dated (but not boned, thank you very much) just about every flavor of man. Not to mention the fact that I&rsquo;m incredibly observant, hyper-intelligent and down to shoot you straight&hellip; basically, I&rsquo;m one of the coolest women you&rsquo;ll never (want to) date. Apparently the scandal is a bit much to handle... or so I\'ve been told. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">[To the readers: that\'s as rah rah \"go me\" as I\'m ever going to get in a blog post, my apologies. However, not to sound arrogant, but I\'d like the record to show that the above-stated is an accurate description]<br /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>To Cuddle, or Not to Cuddle: That is a Stupid Question </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Cuddling, or whatever you want to call it, is a seemingly insignificant aspect of dating, sex and relationships that causes needless drama. Basically, men just need to suck it up and give in&hellip; especially when she sucks it up and gives in. It&rsquo;s comforting, intimate and there is also a primal, scientific explanation for its importance. It dates back to the prehistoric era. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">After a man and a woman<strong>*</strong> have sex a part of the female brain kicks into overdrive and communicates to her that there is a possibility that she could have become pregnant, which, as a result, puts her in a vulnerable position post-coitus. So, she craves protection from her male counterpart and cuddling lends itself quite nicely as a means of providing a sense of security from the various threats out there in the wild -whether it be a Pterodactyl or other cave men. While women of today don&rsquo;t face these particular dangers anymore, the inherent need for some illusion of safety still exists. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">You men may be shaking your heads, exclaiming that intercourse is tiring, that you&rsquo;re hardwired to fall asleep afterward and that there&rsquo;s nothing you can &ndash;or want- to do about that. Additionally, some of you may be thinking that women should just recognize that there is no need to fear dinosaurs and Homo sapiens anymore and that we should just, therefore, adapt. To this I offer the following counterargument: turn on any daytime talk show -be it Montel Williams or Maury Povich- and there are countless men facing multiple paternity tests from multiple baby mamma&rsquo;s who claim that its not their fault and that they&rsquo;re programmed to &ldquo;spread their seed&rdquo;. Men throughout history have utilized this age-old excuse in an attempt to justify a multitude of bad behaviors. You want to maintain ownership over that highly convenient explanation? Well, you&rsquo;re going to have to accept a few convenient explanations of ours. As always, compromise seems to be the name of the game. So get over yourself and throw your arms around her for a little bit after you get your freak on. The payoff is worth the uncomfortable positioning, trust me. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>*</strong> Sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to disclude same sex couples but in the interest of keeping it real I have to admit that I have far too much respect to pretend to have any kind of valuable insight when I, in fact, do not.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Calling All Wingwomen&hellip;</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Having male friends is something that comes highly recommended by yours truly. It&rsquo;s incredibly enlightening as a woman to get a front row seat to the inner-workings of the male psyche and after making it clear to a guy friend that sex is off the table, the relationship that develops is nothing short of eye-opening, educational and fulfilling. Behind every great woman should be an entourage of equally great men. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Women can be incredible assets to their male friends when it comes to picking up chicks. Especially, I might add, if the woman is good-looking. When females see a guy with another girl, and it\'s apparent that the two are not romantically involved, it makes him easier to approach and the feminine &ndash;as opposed to the masculine- wingperson indicates that he is likely sensitive to and understanding of the fairer sex. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">I see it as my duty to assist my guy friends in getting laid at any possible opportunity that presents itself. Obviously, the wingwoman&rsquo;s approach will have to be augmented to every specific pick-up scenario but there are a few general guidelines that when followed, tend to yield positive results for your male buddy. Firstly, pick a girl that is +/- 1 point on the 1-10 scale as your male friend in question (overambitious = less likely that he&rsquo;ll get lucky). Also, make sure she is migrating in a small to mid-size herd and that she is tipsy/borderline drunk. Full-blown drunk chicks are sloppy (aka NOT sexy) and you don&rsquo;t want to lasso your buddy into an un-wanted baby-sitting gig&hellip; not to mention that sleeping with a drunk biddy<strong>** </strong>could have some unfortunate legal implications. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">When you&rsquo;re going in for your initial approach, try commenting on her outfit and/or accessories &ndash;whether you mean it our not. Girls love compliments from other girls on their fashion choices. This is because most girls dress for other girls (but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there). Once you&rsquo;re in make idle chit chat and make sure it&rsquo;s the kind of gab that will require a &ldquo;relationship status&rdquo; disclosure on her part. For example, you could say something along the lines of &ldquo;Sucks how there aren&rsquo;t any cute guys here&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the bartender looks like a quasi-JFK? Do you know if he&rsquo;s single?&rdquo;. Girls in relationships love nothing more than pointing out to single chicks that they don&rsquo;t have to worry about such things, like finding cute boys, anymore because they are worthy of the arbitrary &ldquo;girlfriend&rdquo; title. So, opening lines such as the above-stated have a high chance of success in determining if she is fair game. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Once you&rsquo;ve established that she&rsquo;s single, your guy friend should be introduced and it&rsquo;s at this point that you should go back and fourth between breaking his balls and borderline flirting with him in her presence. This will both communicate his single status and incite a competitive urge within your potential target. Be sure to make him appear virile, successful and in high demand. It will also be your responsibility to deal with any of her friends should they enter the scene, which is why the small to mid-size group is ideal. Lead the conversation and when you see the other woman try and single him out for some one-on-one time, don&rsquo;t miss your cue: make yourself scarce and watch nature take its course. It can be as easy as fishing in a barrel&hellip; it&rsquo;s not even fair. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>**</strong> I\'m going to go ahead and use the \"term of endearment\" defense</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Fake It Don&rsquo;t Break It</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">To begin, let me make it clear that I do not condone faking an orgasm on a regular basis. Not only is it counterproductive, its also a disservice to every other woman he may or may not sleep with in the future. Also, it means you wont be getting off, which, needless to say, is less-than-preferable. However, there are certain rare occasions where an award winning performance is necessary. For the record, I am basing this on the assumption that your partner has brought you to fruition before. For some couples this is quite an assumption to make and I apologize but this doesn&rsquo;t pertain to you. If you&rsquo;re yet to reach climax with your significant other you need to masturbate more&hellip; homeboy isn&rsquo;t a mind reader. But I digress&hellip; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">There are times when it just isn&rsquo;t going to happen. He&rsquo;s not doing anything wrong per se but for some reason he&rsquo;s not doing anything right, either. Maybe you&rsquo;re stressed out, having a fat day or your clit and/or g-spot just don&rsquo;t seem to want to cooperate. Whatever the issue may be, we&rsquo;ve all been in those awkward situations where despite the quality of sex a strong finish just isn&rsquo;t in the cards. And if he starts to get frustrated that you aren&rsquo;t getting off and -God forbid- even comments on it, things become that much more difficult. So, its for scenarios such as this one that faking it is just the way to go: he&rsquo;s tired and you&rsquo;re getting drier with each thrust but you don&rsquo;t want to leave him feeling inadequate because, after all, he&rsquo;s usually quite adept at getting you off. So, give his member &ndash;and his worried mind- a respite and bust out your inner actress.&nbsp; However, men are getting better at spotting the counterfeit culminations so here are a few tips for how to fake it like champ&hellip; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">To begin with, start breathing heavily and at an ever-increasing pace. Sidenote: I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s easier to achieve a more believable fake orgasm in either the missionary or girl-on-top positions... just a random, personal observation -take it or leave it. In any event, start moving faster and take the moaning up a notch but don&rsquo;t overdo it: that&rsquo;s a dead giveaway. It is at this juncture that he&rsquo;ll probably start to get excited at the prospect of finishing you off and he&rsquo;ll also start to move with haste, which is perfect because he&rsquo;ll be distracted. Throw in some dirty talk (for good measure) and maybe even tell him how &ldquo;close&rdquo; you are. Now, at a steady rate, get increasingly fake aroused and start repeating words and/or phrases like &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; or &ldquo;oh, God!&rdquo;. When you&rsquo;re finally ready to take a bow, yell/scream/shriek that you&rsquo;re &ldquo;coming&rdquo; and clench your muscles downstairs over and over again like you&rsquo;re doing a bunch of kegel exercises: this emulates the way your vaginal walls contract during an actual climax. Slowly bring yourself back to neutral, pretend to be overcome with pleasure, show him some affection/appreciation (you should be doing this anyway, whether he finished you off or not) and hop off of his over-worked man parts. And there you go: a convincing, albeit fake, orgasm. To the ladies: you&rsquo;re welcome. And to the gentlemen: this is for your own good. In summation, let me reiterate: this should be done out of necessity in dire situations <em>only</em>. Faking is stupid, probably insulting and dishonest- an all-around negative. But sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to take one for the team.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Written by a.g., special to connectingsexes.</strong> </span></strong></p>','talesfromthedate','2011-10-07 21:09:28','2012-01-09 21:20:46',5,'307286_10100557570251549_828624_59433503_930756210_n.jpg','image/jpeg',88916,'2011-10-07 21:09:27',0,'2012-01-09 21:20:46',1,'what-up-world','What Up, World?

I&rsquo;ve made out with other girls before -drunkenly and for the attention of high school boys, of course. I took a body shot off of a few chicks in college&hellip; and it happened again, I&rsquo;ll admit, in graduate school. Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve wondered on occasion what exactly it would be like to be intimate with a woman, but only because I&rsquo;ve never expanded those particular horizons and can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine what the experience would be like. I&rsquo;ve always said that if I were to ever have a m&eacute;nage-a-trois it would be with a man and another woman, hands down. So, in light of all this, am I bi? I really don&rsquo;t know. When two girls are experimenting, are all &ldquo;intimate&rdquo; acts created equal or do only certain ones &ldquo;count&rdquo; (i.e. oral sex)? &nbsp;Do you actually have to act on your curiosities in order to be considered &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; in the sexual orientation department?

I guess that&rsquo;s just how we are. I&rsquo;ve definitely looked at a hot chick before and thought &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go gay for her, absolutely&rdquo;. Apparently, I once even left my phone number on a receipt for a hot female bartender: I can&rsquo;t say I remember much from that night but I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past me. So whether you&rsquo;d consider me borderline bi-sexual or not I&rsquo;m still going to check out the fairer sex to my hearts content. In honor of my refusal to keep my eyes to myself, here&rsquo;s a list of my Top 9 Girl Crushes. I hope <em>everyone</em> enjoys.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>9.

Smoking hot blonde that charges, looks good in a bathing suit and comes laid-back, island attitude included? Can you really ask for anything else?

Today, you can see her play the leading role on Showtime&rsquo;s <em>Shameless</em>, which is hands down one of the best shows on television at the moment. She plays the feisty and independent Fiona Gallagher. Not only does her character make me want to <em>be</em> a better woman, she makes me want to <em>be with</em> a woman.

His fresh watch and bracelets add a cool, un-expected twist and keep the outfit from falling into the &ldquo;run-of-the-mill&rdquo; category. Some people were born to stand out and their ensembles should reflect this. For the record, the cigarette is not an accessory that comes recommended but I&rsquo;m not one to talk.

The bier garten was my childhood playground and the memories of lederhosen, w&uuml;rsten and cups that runneth over are as equally vivid as they are heartwarming. However, drinking to such an extent and in such abundance presents certain challenges in the longevity department. Maintaining ones seeming sobriety and composure while engaging in the age-old beer connoisseur&rsquo;s tradition is not only an exercise in survival but also a true art form. So for any day drinking novice with plans to step up to the big leagues this Oktober, here are a few tips for festing like a boss. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Beer Before Liquor&hellip; Rookie Mistake </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">I must admit that I too have made this error in judgment once before and the result was nothing short of catastrophic. Drinking for hours on end is doable but only when the alcoholic beverage of choice is beer, or something of similar strength. Trust me when I say that adding liquor to the mix will lead you straight down the path to hell&hellip; and it&rsquo;s paved with vomit and poor life decisions. Stick to beer and save yourself, and those around you, the (literal and metaphorical) headache. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>The Best Defense Is A Good Offense: Eat Something </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Booze has a funny way of making smart people do dumb shit. But a full stomach is like kryptonite for the unpleasant, albeit hilarious, side effects of excessive alcohol consumption. If you line your stomach, preferably with something hearty and substantial, you&rsquo;ll not only last significantly longer in the consumption race but the next days hangover will be far less severe. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>If The Beer Is Aplenty, Then There Is No Need For The Double Fist</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">There&rsquo;s no excuse for being a greedy bastard. And, incidentally, there&rsquo;s also no need for it, as it&rsquo;s unlikely that the beer is going to run out during a festival dedicated entirely to said substance. Drink one, and only one, beer at a time and be sure to savor each glass. Drink with all five senses and enjoy one of Gods greatest gifts to man. Oktoberfest is a marathon, not a sprint and drinking with haste and in excess is gluttonous, self-destructive and overeager. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Don&rsquo;t Drink And&hellip;&nbsp; </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Drive, bone, dial, conduct business, make any major life decisions, facebook, operate heavy machinery, conduct a speech (actually, please do&hellip; and film it), text, and get a tattoo/piercing/haircut or any other permanent bodily alteration. Trust me: the above-stated advice is not only sage, but also inspired from actual incidents of day drinking gone awry. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Written by a.g., special to connectingsexes.</strong> </span></strong></p>','talesfromthedate','2011-10-11 05:20:30','2012-01-09 21:18:52',5,'1-1.jpg','image/jpeg',150829,'2011-10-11 05:26:03',0,'2012-01-09 21:18:52',1,'oktoberfest-holiday-drink-still-be-able-to-legally-consent-by-night','Oktoberfest: HoliDAY Drink & Still Be Able To (Legally) Consent By Night '),(99,'Friend or Faux?','<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">So please listen to the message that I send<br /> Don\'t ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend </span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">-Biz Markie (Hear the rest @ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbH3bAvTYjg\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbH3bAvTYjg</a>)</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">While it is true that men and women can, in fact, be just friends, potential suitors are not incorrect in being suspicious if their target in question seems to have a large number of men in their life that are (allegedly) &ldquo;just friends&rdquo;. Many women, myself included, use this designation in order to alleviate the, as it turns out, founded and rational skepticism of others when a male buddy is introduced as &ldquo;my friend ______&rdquo;. However, sometimes a guy is just that&hellip; a friend. But there seems to be a lot of gray area in that there are certain friends with whom you want to be friendlier. So, stop lying to yourself and to those around you and once and for all determine if he&rsquo;s the real friend deal or a future FWB. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Sidenote: unless you&rsquo;re in an exclusive relationship, you are free to have as many &ldquo;friends&rdquo; as you want. However, I have found that if you&rsquo;re honest about the whole friend vs. &ldquo;friend&rdquo; thing, the drama will be increased in the short-term but significantly less prevelant later on down the line. When you&rsquo;re upfront with people they&rsquo;re much more likely to be upfront with you. But again let me stress that as a single woman you don&rsquo;t owe anyone any explanations. <strong>If a man wants to keep tabs on you he&rsquo;s going to have to lock it down first. </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">He&rsquo;s just a friend if you&rsquo;ve never seen his penis&hellip; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: right;\" align=\"right\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">&hellip;He&rsquo;s more than just a friend if you want to see his penis</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">He&rsquo;s just a friend if you don&rsquo;t feel the need to turn on the faucet when you use his bathroom&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: right;\" align=\"right\">&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">&hellip;He&rsquo;s more than just a friend if you wear your &ldquo;do me&rdquo; underwear when you hang out with him.

I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s taken me this long to realize that dating men in their thirties is the way to go. While I&rsquo;ll never be one to turn down a honey in is twenties, men in this age bracket just seem to do it for me. Whether it&rsquo;s their cool, self-assured nature, apparent allergy to bullshit and superiority between the sheets, I find myself willfully falling victim to the thirty-something&rsquo;s power. However, as is generally the case, there are some drawbacks to dating men that came of age in the 90&rsquo;s&hellip; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>(According To Them) They Know <em>Everything</em> </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">From which band -Pearl Jam or Nirvana- is real grunge to predicting who will likely be president in 2012, their determinations are not opinions but, as it turns out, facts of life. They firmly believe that growing up in the 90&rsquo;s was simply better than growing up in the early 2000&rsquo;s and, due to this, their tastes across the board carry significantly more power of authority. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how intelligent, mature for your age or experienced you are, they&rsquo;re right&hellip; and you&rsquo;re wrong. For the record, Nirvana isn&rsquo;t real grunge, it <em>is</em> grunge. Pearl Jam is my jam but Nirvana wins out in that debate and I don&rsquo;t care how many of you in your thirties disagree. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Why this doesn&rsquo;t matter: Popular music was better in the 90&rsquo;s. We have to search for it nowadays. Facebook didn&rsquo;t exist and people could, therefore, do whatever they wanted without worry of having it permanently chronicled on the world-wide-web. And, at the end of the day, they&rsquo;re older and a certain amount of wisdom does come with age. But often times when someone is dating a much younger individual it isn\'t your youth they&rsquo;re seeking but rather their own. So, take advantage of this and introduce them to the youth culture of today. Even though they&rsquo;ll claim they had it better, they really do appreciate the behind the scenes expose. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Sex Will Be Better&hellip; But Those Prone To Starfish Need Not Apply </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Men in their thirties have been boning for much longer than guys in their twenties. Additionally, many of them have experienced several longer-term relationships, which means they&rsquo;ve had to actually learn how to please a woman. A lot of the boys our age stick to one-night-stands, which, truth be told, are seldom pleasurable. However, these older men have busy lives and that takes it\'s sexual toll. A lot of the time they&rsquo;ll be tired and unlike their younger counter-parts, who still think sex is the coolest thing since sliced bread, there will be times when going to sleep is the more attractive option than taking care of your sexual needs. Translation: You&rsquo;re going to have to pull your own weight in the bedroom. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Why this doesn&rsquo;t matter: I have found that not only is taking a more active role educational, but more pleasurable as well. You&rsquo;ll find yourself on top a lot of the time but on the rare occasions when they do get on top of you, it\'ll count. Instead of having multiple fast and furious sessions, you&rsquo;ll get one shot and it&rsquo;ll be better than a night of non-stop mediocre sex. Its quality&hellip; not quantity. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Who&rsquo;s Your Daddy?

When they&rsquo;re angry with you it&rsquo;s reminiscent of that time you missed curfew in junior high and dad got pissed. And when you do argue the condescension will be palpable and instead of wanting some serious make-up sex post fight you&rsquo;ll worry that you&rsquo;ll be made to sit in the corner and think about what you&rsquo;ve done. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on the potential for awkwardness when he spanks you in bed&hellip;. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Why this doesn&rsquo;t matter: He&rsquo;s not your dad (hopefully). And unless he&rsquo;s a twisted pervert that once made a cameo appearance on <em>To Catch A Predator</em>, he doesn&rsquo;t think of himself as your dad. Which means it&rsquo;s in your head&hellip; and that&rsquo;s a little too Freudian for me. So, stop thinking about it. If you must (and I\'m really not sure why this would ever be a must but there are some damaged women out there), think of him as a dirty uncle instead... too far?

Wasting no time, Mr. Jones lent his voice to the organization for the night and was rocking some seriously standout style in the process. Specifically, it was his festive bow tie that caught the eye among the slew of the tried and true black ties. When I asked about it he informed me that he founded and currently powers an organization called <strong>Bow Tie Cause</strong>, which boasts a cool collection of high-end bow ties that commemorate a wide selection of charitable organizations close to the former linebackers heart.

Halloween is that one time of year when we can all dress like a slut and not be judged for it&hellip; but not really though. You&rsquo;re being judged: by other women but more importantly by the guys out there looking for a holiday pick-me-up. So, depending on your personal goals for the evening you should plan to adjust your costume accordingly. It isn&rsquo;t fair but it&rsquo;s the reality. If you dress like a Playboy &ldquo;cyber girl of the week&rdquo; wannabe, he&rsquo;ll aim for the hit n&rsquo; quit. Unless you are, in fact, looking to whore yourself out this year cover up a <em>little</em> and maybe even show some creativity in your guise. I&rsquo;m no prude and I firmly believe in playing up the ass(ets) but unfortunately we still live in a day and age where you will be asking for certain presumptions to be made about you should you forgo modesty on this highly overrated of &ldquo;holidays&rdquo;. So I dedicate this article to the ladies out there still engaged in the all-important Halloween costume selection process: avoid looking like the trick, take your standards up a notch and go as the treat. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">To any of you gentlemen reading, a quick note to begin and end: you are what you eat.

So, at 7 pm the night of you ran to some pop-up theme store or Ricky&rsquo;s, waited in an obscenely long line and grabbed anything that was available in a size other than XS or XL.

Anyone that has dedicated so much energy towards something as unimportant as a Halloween costume clearly wants&nbsp; -and probably needs- to get laid.&nbsp; And if the outfit was \"appropriate\" at the beginning of the night yet, somehow, conveniently depletes throughout the evening until you&rsquo;re left rocking straight lingerie, you fall into the trick category. At least your fellow tricks were straight-forward and just showed up with their intentions, and body parts, on display. You faked everyone out, yourself included. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>*</strong>In case you were curious, I\'m going as the anti-MILF: the \"I\'m Proud of My Honor Student\" t-shirt, mom jeans, fanny pack and scrunchie included.

I think that while overused, there are occasions where someone is, in fact, being a bitch and no other word sums it up quite as definitively. However, I&rsquo;m not a fan of bitches and the girl on girl playa hating is needless, counterproductive and indicative of some deep-seeded issues with our gender at large. This whole &ldquo;proud to be a bitch&rdquo; non-sense confuses me as well. Since when is it cool to suck? I hear so many girls openly gush about being a so-called bitch and apparently for whatever reason all of us are supposed to be impressed. Well I, for one, am not. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">I&rsquo;m blessed with some of the finest (in more ways than one) female friends available on the market but I can probably count on two hands the amount of girls with which I share a genuine and loyal friendship. I&rsquo;m a skilled listener who is more-or-less agreeable and always up for some quality female bonding so something isn&rsquo;t computing here. And I&rsquo;m not alone: many women I know complain that a BFF is hard to find and that guys are, on the whole, far easier to befriend. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">And <strong>bitches are to blame</strong> for this. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">I had a recent run-in with one of these dastardly creatures. She was someone who I didn&rsquo;t know very well but had apparently spoken to on one occasion&hellip; at around 4 am. For the record: if I haven&rsquo;t held a coherent, semi-intelligent conversation with you sober(ish), we don&rsquo;t know each other&hellip; sorry. Anyway, she was making it clear that she wasn&rsquo;t a fan of mine and communicated this with shameless disregard, as I was well within earshot. I could honestly care less. She doesn&rsquo;t know me, I don&rsquo;t know her and she&rsquo;s probably jealous for some unknown reason- that or this was all over a guy somehow, which is generally the case. I&rsquo;m still a kid in some cultures so why, grown ass woman, do you care enough about me &ndash;someone you don&rsquo;t know- to stir up trouble? Her display was not only straight whack but also more than a little pathetic. She&rsquo;s lucky that I wasn\'t raised to throw hooks, although I must warn that my left is solid: better recognize, bitch. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Girls, we need to stop hating on each other. The world can be&nbsp; an un-forgiving place and the last thing any of us need is yet another person dead set on cutting us down, making us feel even worse than we, likely, already do. And it&rsquo;s even more distressing when the perpetrator is one of our own. If you&rsquo;re not going to chill out with the conniving tendencies and defamatory remarks towards your fellow woman for the sake of feminism than perhaps this will encourage a change in your behavior: guys find this bullshit incredibly un-attractive.&nbsp; Now do I have your attention? </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">When you&rsquo;re talking smack about another female, unless she ran over you with her car, went down on your boyfriend or called you fat you&rsquo;re making yourself look like a total d-bag. And guys are taking mental note of this. If you can back stab one of your own with such ease and with such seeming pleasure (many girls <em>do</em> get off on gossip), they will begin to wonder what you&rsquo;re going to say about them should anything ever go down. Take a look at the standard male entourage: not only do they keep each other&rsquo;s business on the DL but even during times when they aren&rsquo;t getting along there is no shit talking&hellip; at least not in a public setting and for personal attention. Basically, when you make yourself seem petty and fake by lamenting about something stupid some other chick said, did or was wearing what he hears is that he can&rsquo;t trust you and without trust you basically have nothing&hellip; it&rsquo;s hard out there for a bitch. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;\">It&rsquo;s time to reclaim the word. Spread it. If a girl is acting up, call it like you see it. Ladies, we all know when we&rsquo;re crossing the line and if/when you do, you&rsquo;re being a bitch and not in a good way&hellip; as if there was such a thing. If you like some chick&rsquo;s outfit, instead of being envious ask her where she got it. If she&rsquo;s dating your sloppy seconds take solace in the fact that you got to the prize first, even if he was the one who ended things. And if he was the one to 86 the involvement hating her isn&rsquo;t going to make him want you back. In fact he&rsquo;s probably getting a nice ego stroke out of seeing you get worked up over it so don\'t give him that satisfaction.

Every individual I&rsquo;ve been with has taught me things and expanded horizons that would have otherwise remained un-explored. This should be the case for everyone unless, of course, you just have really bad taste in people. They also say that there&rsquo;s nothing in life as tragic as a missed opportunity. And with that I&rsquo;d never argue.

The Zac Brown Band hails from Georgia and the musical and lyrical talent is remarkable, which is made explicit by both the live and recorded sound. Zac Brown&rsquo;s voice is probably one of my favorites at present time. It&rsquo;s so good I could listen to his <em>live</em> vocals whilst hungover&hellip;.

Bush relented and gave in to Congress, which sparked a series of unfortunate events in which he would continually bend to the Democratic will. Unemployment, poverty and welfare programs increased and the United States even experienced a &ldquo;mild&rdquo; recession, lasting around six months (those were the days): guess we should have curbed government spending.

Many of his major decisions as President were both divisive and highly criticized, earning him the <strong>reputation as one of the Nation&rsquo;s worst Commander&rsquo;s in Chief</strong>. These unfavorable Presidential determinations include favoring the Missouri Compromise and effectively repealing the Kansas-Nebraska act, which continued the debate over slavery in the west. Not to mention the Ostend Manifesto, which was drafted as a proposal to purchase Cuba from Spain and to declare war on the European Nation should they refuse. He basically hammered the last nail in his reputations coffin when he came out in support of the Confederacy during the American Civil War: dude was from New Hampshire. While I respect the boldness, Mr. Pierce, that was &ndash;for lack of a better word- stupid (politically and morally, obviously). But the fact remains that <strong>President Pierce was a fine looking post-Colonial</strong>. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Pierce and his beloved head of hair: <a href=\"http://www.mindspring.com/%7Edbholzel/pierce/pierce.html\">http://www.mindspring.com/~dbholzel/pierce/pierce.html</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>2. George W. Bush </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">His administration was characterized by tax cuts, two wars and a free-market approach that intended to lessen the role of government in the private business sector. An advocate for ownership, he believed strongly in personal accountability, smaller government and the obtaining of property. Bush\'s fiscal legacy is one of a worsening mortgage crisis and massive government interventions that came in the form of the infamous \"bailout\" (I\'m&nbsp; not only referring to the financial institutions but also <strong>Fannie and Freddie</strong>). Additonally, the United States Armed Forces were fighting wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq- wars that, as we all know, continue today. The above-metioned plus the controversial Bush tax cuts made for a rise in the National debt. Although extremely un-popular, the fact remains that W. was good-looking back in his heyday. Not gonna lie&hellip; I would have dated him. He was a graduate of Yale University (like his daddy) and one thing is for certain: Mr. President knew how to party. <strong>Whether you jumped on the anti-Bush bandwagon or not you have to admit that he was eye-catching in his earlier years</strong>. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Bush the cute college coed:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><a href=\"http://images.library.yale.edu/madid/oneItem.aspx?id=1771848&amp;q=&amp;q1=0684&amp;q2=&amp;qc1=contains&amp;qc2=&amp;qf1=subject1&amp;qf2=&amp;qn=&amp;qo=&amp;qm=15&amp;qs=136&amp;sid=&amp;qx=1004.1\">http://images.library.yale.edu/madid/oneItem.aspx?id=1771848&amp;q=&amp;q1=0684&amp;q2=&amp;qc1=contains&amp;qc2=&amp;qf1=subject1&amp;qf2=&amp;qn=&amp;qo=&amp;qm=15&amp;qs=136&amp;sid=&amp;qx=1004.1</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>1.

Upon being sworn into Presidency, JFK sought to loosen fiscal policy, lower interest rates and encourage the growth of the American economy. The Eisenhower administration left him with a steadily declining GDP and a steadily increasing un-employment rate, yet in his short duration as President the economy experienced an incitement of note. However, the stock market was not quite as healthy and the Kennedy administration&rsquo;s punitive actions against the steel industry can be said to have encouraged this decline. Whether you&rsquo;re a fan of Kennedy&rsquo;s economic policies or not, he was an ostensible heartbreaker, although actually a <strong>bona fide beauty of a man- on the outside as well as the in</strong>. Meeting an untimely death as a result of a successful assassination attempt, he will forever remain one of America&rsquo;s most beloved political and social figures. From his celebrated marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to his well-recorded affair with the legendary Marilyn Monroe, it is <strong>entirely logical that some of the world&rsquo;s most eligible bachelorettes wanted a piece of that</strong> Presidential smoke show. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Honorable Mentions: </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Dude abolished slavery... and never told a lie.

Apparently, they have neighbors. I blame porn, but fully recognize and appreciate the appeal of porn. It can be hot and when you\'re stuck in a London hotel with nothing to do (true story), it can be very handy -so to speak. I\'m not, however, into some of this crazy fetish stuff out there. But I&rsquo;m not one to judge&hellip; unless its kiddie. When you like watching kids in scenes that are nothing short of sexually explicious (now a real word), I judge. Hard. And if you actually <strong>have sex with children, I kind of stop caring about your rights.</strong> But that&rsquo;s just me.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Text messages</strong>. They like being able to send text messages themselves, as it&rsquo;s impersonal, efficient and allows avoidance should that be desired, but they do not particularly enjoy the ones we send. At least, not the rambling, interrogative and &ndash;truth be told- insignificant text novels that are sent in abundance. <strong>&nbsp;I have a problem with text messaging and I am not too proud to admit this.</strong> So, learn from my mistakes and never, and I mean never, send the follow up text. He got it, he is just either busy and/or ignoring you. Additionally, never text anything pertaining to your &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; that should, instead, be discussed in person. Once establishing this as the status quo, where important matters are handled via technology, intimacy is shot and arguments have a funny way of escalating. When you have to think about what you&rsquo;re going to say to their face, priorities and things of <em>actual</em> importance make themselves clearer.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Changing their facebook relationship status</strong>. And quite frankly, I agree. It sucks when you break up and make the dreaded switch from &ldquo;in a relationship&rdquo; to &ldquo;single&rdquo;, because there is bound to be a few &ldquo;friends&rdquo; that comment on it (with sympathy, regret and words of support that do nothing but make you feel worse) and even a few &ldquo;friends&rdquo; that &ldquo;like&rdquo; it. However, if the relationship is a longer-term one and your significant other tends to garner admiration from the opposite sex, it can be appropriate. <strong>But I think that if we all had to be honest, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s complicated&rdquo; is probably the more accurate status.</strong> Mine should read &ldquo;it&rsquo;s complicated&hellip; with myself&rdquo;. But instead, for now I&rsquo;m going with &ldquo;single&rdquo;&hellip; which is highly accurate as well.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong>Girls that are insecure about letting them go downtown</strong>. Yeah, I get that you like it and when she refuses it makes her appear like she&rsquo;s hiding something but unfortunately this insecurity can generally be blamed on the previous men she&rsquo;s dated. Not all dudes are like you. If you like wandering south, that puts you in a different category. Congrats. Your slacker fellow men are to blame for any inconvenient residual negatives that you may be dealing with. Vagina probably has an &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; smell, taste and or/texture. I can only imagine. Many &ldquo;men&rdquo; see giving oral as a special occasion and while I get that cunnilingus is more of a production than fellatio (I hate both of those words), the incredible discrepancy seen in many heterosexual couples can breed some insecurity. It&rsquo;s like one guy makes us feel as if there&rsquo;s something wrong down below and then the next guy gets mad that we don&rsquo;t feel 100% comfortable letting him put his entire face in that vicinity. Damned if we do, damned if we don&rsquo;t. <strong>Kind of how you boys feel when a girl you&rsquo;re involved with asks if you think her smoke show best friend is &ldquo;attractive&rdquo;. </strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><strong><strong>Written by a.g., special to connectingsexes.</strong> </strong></span></p>','talesfromthedate','2011-10-27 08:55:56','2012-01-09 21:15:09',5,'cunnilingus.png','image/png',151812,'2011-10-27 08:55:54',0,'2012-01-09 21:15:09',1,'ok-so-apparently-guys-dont-like-these-things','ok...-so,-apparently-guys-don\'t-like-these- things '),(131,'Only the Lonely Text Back','<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Communication Breakdown II: Only the Lonely Text Back&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">If you read my last post, \"Communication Breakdown I: Can You Hear Me Now?\"&mdash;and if you didn\'t, you should&mdash;men phone, little boys text.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Likewise, women return a call with a call; little girls, with a text.

I don\'t speak \"I never get laid\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Barney: Jesus waited THREE days to come back to life. It was perfect! If he had only waited ONE day, a lot of people wouldn\'t have even heard he died. They\'d be all, \"Hey Jesus, what up?\" and Jesus would probably be like, \"What up? I DIED yesterday!\" and they\'d be all, \"Uhh, you look pretty alive to me, dude...\" and then Jesus would have to explain how he was resurrected, and how it was a miracle, and the dude\'d be like \"Uhh okay, whatever you say, bro...\" And he\'s not gonna come back on a SATURDAY. Everybody\'s busy, doing chores, workin\' the loom, trimmin\' the beard, NO. He waited the perfect number of days, THREE. Plus it\'s SUNDAY, so everyone\'s in church already, and they\'re all in there like \"Oh no, Jesus is DEAD\", and then BAM! He bursts in the back door, runnin\' up the aisle, everyone\'s totally psyched, and FYI, that\'s when he invented the high five. That\'s why we wait three days to call a woman, because that\'s how long Jesus wants us to wait....

Its Just Pussy','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">I&rsquo;m a life long guy&rsquo;s girl and I&rsquo;ve always had a healthy amount of male friends, only a few of which I&rsquo;ve slept with (go me). All of this quality male bonding has truly enlightened me and I&rsquo;ve come to a conclusion that I believe will be of benefit to both sexes. Ladies: when you make it clear to a guy friend that his only option is his left hand (not yours), don&rsquo;t get all bummed out when he doesn&rsquo;t want to hang out as much. You&rsquo;re still his friend, he still cares about you, but he needs to get laid. And since you&rsquo;ve removed your holiest of holes from the list of potentials he needs to switch gears and focus on another target.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Also, it is NOT fair to pretend to want to sleep with him after all when he starts to apply his attention elsewhere just for the sheer fun of it. If that&rsquo;s how you get your entertainment these days you are lame and you need to get a life. There&rsquo;s no reason why men and women can&rsquo;t get along but we need to meet each other halfway. So basically it goes like this: boy meets girl, boy befriends girl, boy makes move on girl, girl rejects boy saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to ruin our friendship&rdquo;, boy loses girl (and erection), boy finds girl 2.0, and the rest is history. Leave it at that. When a guy friend starts to branch out, just go with the flow- and depending on how good of a friend he is you might even consider enduring the rumor that the two of you drunkenly hooked up&hellip; the rumor he created of course. The male ego is delicate. That&rsquo;s just a fact.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong><strong>Written by a.g., special to connectingsexes.</strong></strong></span></p>','talesfromthedate','2011-11-10 12:47:39','2012-01-09 21:14:58',5,'friends-with-benefits.jpg','image/jpeg',21530,'2011-11-10 14:05:04',0,'2012-01-09 21:14:58',1,'its-not-personal-its-just-pussy','its-not-personal-its-just-pussy'),(154,'Stand By Your Man... Sometimes ','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Dating advice &ndash;and advice on men in general- from female friends should be taken with a grain of salt. They&rsquo;re women and, by no fault of their own, usually don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about. This includes me, so consider this my disclaimer: just because I choose to write about dating does not mean you should take all, if any, of my advice. I blog, therefore I am&hellip; most likely as clueless as anyone when it comes to the sex I wish to sex.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">I&rsquo;ve always found it funny how when I&rsquo;m single, many girlfriends express enthusiasm at the prospect of me becoming less than single. However, as soon as I couple up all conversations tend to come to the same conclusion: dump him. He doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;deserve&rdquo; me and I can do &ldquo;better&rdquo; (allegedly). But, to quote the film <em>Clueless</em> (Amy Heckerling&rsquo;s epic coming of age tale that was both highly observant and socially relevant), &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m too good for him, how come I&rsquo;m not with him?&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\">Sometimes, you should just stand by your man. Men are annoying as hell. They do, and say, some truly dumb shit. Putting their foot in their mouths is their favorite past time, and most &ndash;if not all- are extremely good at it. And let&rsquo;s be honest: women are no walks in the park either. But that&rsquo;s what keeps it interesting. Remember that <strong>there can be no spark with out tension</strong>. Obviously if he&rsquo;s &ldquo;abusive&rdquo;, truly a loser or the sex is bad then by all means&hellip; drop him like a bad habit. But if he misses his cue to feed you attention on occasion and doesn&rsquo;t heed to your every demand, this is not necessarily evidence of his inability to make you happy in the long run. It&rsquo;s just evidence that you&rsquo;re dating a man, a fellow human being independent to you, and that perhaps you may have to express your wants and needs verbally instead of banking on the fact that he&rsquo;s a mind reader. I&rsquo;ve dated a lot of guys but I&rsquo;m yet to experience a mind reader.

Other girls like to stare and this both arouses and infuriates you (a really healthy combo&hellip;. no, seriously). Because he&rsquo;s been a looker for some time, his looks are a part of his identity. Any good-looking individual that says otherwise is lying. In fact, appearance is a major part of an unattractive individuals identity as well. However, the masses only tend take issue with the hotties in the ranks. So yes, he acts like a douche on occasion and may seem narcissistic at times. But the key phrase is he acts <em>like</em> a douche, he isn&rsquo;t actually a douche. When he&rsquo;s mad at you and is trying to get a rise he may flirt with some dumb biddy in your presence. But because <strong>deep down he&rsquo;s a great guy that always seems to come through for you at times when you <em>actually</em> need him</strong>, it is likely that he is acutely aware of how unfulfilling that biddy probably is and his flirting will serve more as ignition for make-up sex with you and less as a means for post break-up sex with her&hellip; unless you&rsquo;re an idiot that can&rsquo;t see the glaring potential in a man that is good-hearted and good-looking. That doesn&rsquo;t happen often so if physical attraction and good character are things you&rsquo;re looking for in a partner, you&rsquo;re going to have to cut them slack at times.

The Almost Alpha, however, is the guy that has been thrust into the role of alpha due to his God given charismatic personality and undeniable appeal to both men and women but still has some insecurity to work through (don&rsquo;t we all). Men, in general, have a lot of pressure placed upon them to be strong, confident and in 100% control of 100% of situations. And the alphas live up to these expectations day in and day out. If he&rsquo;s young, has a lot of baggage and/or has experienced the worst us women have to offer he is still getting comfortable with himself and can, therefore, falter as top dog on occasion. <strong>The key phrase there is <em>on occasion</em>.</strong> As in: if he&rsquo;s always failing to meet the alpha standard of manliness he is not an alpha in training, he&rsquo;s a wannabe showing some true colors.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: large;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Written by a.g., special to connectingsexes.</strong></span><br /></span></p>','talesfromthedate','2011-11-16 02:49:36','2012-01-09 21:14:33',5,'samposter-1.jpg','image/jpeg',42667,'2011-11-16 02:49:35',0,'2012-01-09 21:14:33',1,'tale-of-two-men','Tale Of Two \"Men\" '),(157,'A Little Exercise Everyday','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Exercise should be a part of every day!

But it was Freshman year, give me a break.\"</p>\r\n<p>ConnectingSexes: Welcome to another ConnectingSexes.com interview! I\'m glad you could come Susan, since most girls don\'t. That was lame. Let\'s get started. So if you could introduce yourself?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Hey my name is Susan, I\'m from Brooklyn. I\'m a Business Major at University of Vermont and I\'m 21</p>\r\n<p>CS: Good intro. Born and raised Brooklynite or what?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Born there, full-blooded New Yorker.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Always great to hear. So how do you like UVM?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Hm, it\'s like most schools, has it\'s ups and downs. Gorgeous setting though. Senior year here. Love it but wouldn\'t live here.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Excited to graduate?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Yes, about damn time I get paid for the papers I write.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Going to come back to New York?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Hopefully, wherever I can find work</p>\r\n<p>CS: Rough times, understood. So are you single or taken?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Single</p>\r\n<p>CS: Follow-up question, What are you doing Friday night? Totally joking. But not really. How\'s the dating scene in Vermont?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: It\'s like a giant swingers party. A few couples, very few. Great town, great variety, lots of girls and guy. Guys just don\'t like to date here though. They have a &ldquo;Bang and go&rdquo; philosophy. It\'s a candy store ideology.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Alright, have you ever been in a 1 on 1 date?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Like a normal date?</p>\r\n<p>CS: Yeah like they did back in the 60\'s. And if yes how was it?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: It\'s nice to find a guy who wants dinner before drinks and before sex.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Well any dating horror stories?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Actually...yes....in New York. A friend of a friend was in town. He was in his late 20\'s. It was obvious he was very foreign, but it was a bit obnoxious. A tight pink gap polo that</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;was so tight that his chest hair was popping out of the polo.</p>\r\n<p>CS: that\'s horrific. How do you feel about going dutch?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: I\'ll make the move and see how he feels about it, if he wants to go dutch I\'ll go dutch. It\'s the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Kudos on that. So tell me a drunk fail of yours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Like fall on my face or....wake up next to some guy and having major regrets.?</p>\r\n<p>CS: Whichever floats your boat.</p>\r\n<p>Susie: My Freshman year Halloween, me and 3 other girls dressed as Greek goddesses, because we waited till the last minute. This was the first time I drank Bacardi 151 and I significantly underestimated how drunk it gets you. So we ended up getting very, very, very intoxicated. I went from Greek Goddess to Gladiator because I managed to fall 4 times. Skinned both knees. Bruised my fore</p>\r\n<p>head and arms. I managed to fall again in front of a friend, who yelled to my friend in a cat costume &ldquo;Kitty go save her!&rdquo; because at that point I was covered in blood. At that point it was decided that I should go home.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Rough. That wasn\'t even funny, what the fuck?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: I think I was taken home by a Penguin. But it was Freshman year, give me a break.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Just this once. So you\'re at a bar. Some guy approaches you. What are the top things he can do where you just know &ldquo;This guy isn\'t getting laid&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Susie:Hm...biggest turn offs....Talking about your ex. You can\'t do that. Being generally rude or obnoxious, screaming or spitting when they talk. It\'s loud here but you don\'t need to scream at my face. Bad breath. No job I suppose? The conversation matters the most, if he\'s boring, can\'t</p>\r\n<p>hold a conversation or has nothing interesting to say, well I\'m not going to be interested.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Best answer for any question in any interview. Have I mentioned I love you?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: You have, but I don\'t mind hearing it again.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Glad I can be of service. So more skankalicious questions. What is your Go-To underwear, I\'m a guy so I assume all these things, but you plan to go out, and you hope to see a guy you\'re interested in , so what do you go for?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Well I used to work at Victoria Secret, so I\'ve gathered quite a collection of their garments. I really like their lace boy shorts and hip huggers. Easy to wear, comfortable, don\'t ride up. If I have to keep fixing my underwear, huge turn off. You don\'t want to see a girl standing there pick underwear out of her ass.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Side note- I do like watching women pick underwear out of their ass.</p>\r\n<p>Susie: ...Whatever</p>\r\n<p>CS: Kidding a little I guess. Although I do love Whale-tail. So how do you feel about military boys?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: I like em, code of honor, physically fit, all that training and scheduling. And a bit of them gotta be pretty smart as well.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Cool cool, So what are some things you do when you\'re attracted to a guy? Better yet, how would the guy know you\'re attracted to him?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Laugh a lot. I can\'t help it, even if it\'s not remotely funny it\'ll crack me up. Smile a lot. Turn red. Hand fidgeting, means I\'m nervous. Keep looking at them.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Good answers. Looking for a closing question for this great interview. <strong>shuffles around blank pages. </strong>Have you ever been on a group date? Your group of girls purposely meet a group of guys and go out.</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Usually me and my girlfriends usually go to the bar and try to find guys. But I\'ve never done it prearranged</p>\r\n<p>CS: So when your girls go out, the overall goal is to find a corresponding group of guys, right?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Yeah we try to match it up to get the number right.</p>\r\n<p>CS: How does it usually work out?</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Well we usually designate roles, my friend will be the wing-man if one of us is interested in a guy. I\'m good at that since I\'m pretty fearless, I just try to talk to them, then my friends come over and if there&rsquo;s interest then it works out. A lot of times guys will come to us also.</p>\r\n<p>CS: I\'m basically engaged so I\'ve been an expert wing-man for a while.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Hahaha</p>\r\n<p>CS: Thank you Susan, best interview ever. Next time I see you, I\'m going to take you on a nice 1 on 1 date, old school style, suit, dress, flower on table. It\'ll be great.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Susie: Yes! I can\'t wait</p>\r\n<p>CS: Thanks again and take care&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Susie:Thanks, bye!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','localcelebrity','2011-12-06 15:12:46','2011-12-09 06:47:38',9,'screen-shot-2011-12-06-at-10.05.47-am.jpg','image/jpeg',33137,'2011-12-06 15:12:46',0,'2011-12-06 15:12:53',1,'localcelebrity-takenhomebypenguin','localcelebrity-takenhomebypenguin'),(174,'Snacks, Snacks, Snacks','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">In order to stay fit and slim, one needs to plan meals and snacks at least with a little thought!

It gets my blood pressure higher than a popped collar.</p>\r\n<p>LN and I met at a destination wedding. From \"hello\" at the rehearsal barbecue, we spent every minute together (not bedtime minutes. Such restraint).</p>\r\n<p>The second we got back to the city from the New England getaway, he called me every single day, telling me how excited he was to see me again that weekend. He planned a marathon Saturday night date for the two of us. I was smitten and in full disclosure, hot off the heels of our friends\' ceremony, had a head full of fantasies. Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>I spent Saturday working backward from pick-up time (ah, picking me up: quel gentleman). Every minute was carefully accounted for: LN wouldn\'t and shouldn\'t be kept waiting! I was shaved, waxed and groomed, showered and perfumed, made-up, dressed&mdash;and pacing.</p>\r\n<p>Two minutes before the appointed hour, a text buzzed in.</p>\r\n<p>\"Running late. Getting a cab soon.\"</p>\r\n<p>My heart sank and my brain kicked into gear.</p>\r\n<p>A whole week of syrupy calls after being my shadow at the wedding, telling me all about the fun plans we\'d be making down the line, and now this? He would be texting me to say he was downstairs if he was into me.</p>\r\n<p>Besides, he must\'ve known he would be late much before now. Why not get in touch then?</p>\r\n<p>Something was going on.</p>\r\n<p>When he eventually rolled up&mdash;nearly an hour after his text and without apology&mdash;I was ready to see if I was right: that LN\'s tardiness signaled he wanted to be anywhere else. Because my date had now morphed into a social experiment, it was easy to smile and resist mentioning I was pissed for being kept waiting (well, maybe not that last one).</p>\r\n<p>LN put a couple feet between us when we walked down the sidewalk, talked to the food on his plate, flirted with the girls at the table next to us, and insulted my footwear: wedges and not heels? Do I like YSLs? Louboutins? Not that he had a shoe fetish&mdash;he was just asking.</p>\r\n<p>As LN dropped me off at the end of the night, he said he would phone me again. I knew he never would. I gave him a tight smile. No need to lie, bud. He rammed his tongue in my mouth (ugh, really? After all that?) Needless to say, I was delighted to run upstairs to fiercely make love to my couch and DVR, all before midnight.</p>\r\n<p>The scoop from our mutual married friends was that LN was actually casually dating a divorcee (complete with daughter). No wonder he was so standoffish, late and rude. I guess he wanted to take the easy way out by turning me off rather than tell me the truth.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, sometimes late happens. Not everyone who\'s running way behind is hiding A Major Secret, like LN. Subways get stuck between stations.

We gym rats watch crap TV, or gaze in an unfocused stare at the street, checking out what awaits after we&rsquo;ve put in our time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">I was knocking out my miles this weekend, huffing and puffing my way to the never-here finish line, when an old flame strolled by.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">(Let\'s call him) SPE lives barely two blocks from me. &nbsp;He was fun, smart, funny, actually had hobbies, and was smooth in every way you care to think of. When things were good, they were excellent, and did I mention we scored a 12 out of 10 for location convenience? The typical New Yorker fears a long-distance relationship, which means having to switch trains. Our concern was catching one set of red lights.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">SPE looked at me. I looked back. He waved. And waved. And waved again. I was startled.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Sucked that I was a hellamess with my ponytail fashioned like a puked-up hairball on top of my head and my face as glamorous as a saltine cracker (wearing make-up during a workout clogs your little pores, don&rsquo;t you know).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">What caught me off-guard was that a girl was immobilizing his other arm, weighing it down like an anvil.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">In our sweet yet tawdry off-again-on-again relationship&mdash;yes, SPE was a permanent recycling-bin dweller (see my last post on Personal Climate Change)&mdash;he was always in the background of my life, like wallpaper. I could and would summon him at any time.&nbsp; And vice-versa.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Now, the insistent waving with his functional arm was to communicate that he had moved on.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Previously, only I had&mdash;by dodging his attempts to make plans, expressing that I was looking for something more/something else, and eventually, bottom line, flat-out saying that what he was able to offer was not &ldquo;My-Next-Boyfriend&rdquo; material. Eventually, I quietly faded out on him.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">However, it appeared quite clearly that he found someone who was happy to pick up what he was throwing down. His arm-flailing said, &ldquo;Yeah! A girl! That&rsquo;s right! Look! See? Do you?&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Even though I got what I wanted, it felt weird to observe SPE with someone else (I&rsquo;m a bitch: she&rsquo;s pretty&mdash;pretty ugly). It confirmed that we are, at last, over. Foh rill. O-V-A-H. And although we have been neighbors these past million years, we have never once bumped into each other with anyone of romantic interest; just with friends, or alone.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Now, having crossed into new, awkward territory, I highly doubt SPE and I will ever (though never&rsquo;s kind of a long time) phone each other again for dinner; and if we do, it would be as nothing more than pals. We&rsquo;ll finally start showing up on time for our reservations, imagine that.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">So thanks, SPE, for fortuitously passing by my gym window with your &ldquo;You Mean You&rsquo;re with HER now?!&rdquo; girlfriend. It was a thoughtful, albeit unintentional, present and gesture. It enabled a little personal holiday housekeeping. The trash and recycling were both taken to the curb.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Tangentially, it also made me think twice about hitting the gym bald-faced.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Perhaps a quick slick of lip-gloss and sweep of mascara before hopping on the treadmill won&rsquo;t clog anything but my schedule.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>e.b.k. lives, plays and dates in new york. she believes the calorie read-out on the treadmill low-balls her efforts.</strong></span></p>','talesfromthedate','2011-12-19 22:56:31','2011-12-20 15:19:16',5,'handwaving.jpg','image/jpeg',69284,'2011-12-19 22:56:30',0,'2011-12-20 15:19:16',1,'hohoho','hohoho'),(189,'Here\'s My Card.

Quintuple whammy of minimal-to-no interest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Party Boy didn&rsquo;t do much better during the taxi-portion part of the evening.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">That one minute he spent exiting the taxi to ask KS to be sure to reach out means squat; why she was glowing over it baffles me.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">If he (or any man) wanted her, a different question would have been posited as he was outside the taxi and saying goodnight:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">&ldquo;Hey KS [whipping out Blackberry/Droid/iPod/pen and paper/chisel and tablet], just in case, what&rsquo;s your number?&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Or better yet, while they were holding hands and talking about nothing in the cab (they were not, according to KS, putting on a show for the driver in the backseat), he could have asked her for her coordinates then. And made out with her, too.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Not one to be coy, KS emailed Party Boy a &ldquo;nice to meet you&rdquo; note the next evening.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;promising&hellip;but after New Year&rsquo;s?&rdquo; read part of her note over his reply, which she forwarded to me.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">To his credit, he responded quickly, asking her out for a drink&mdash;in 2012.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">It&rsquo;s not even Christmas. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">2012 is a long ways away for an anxious girl.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">KS is clearly eager to see him now, now, now. Not because she thinks he&rsquo;s so super and because she wants a boyfriend/husband/anything (which she does).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Come on: she wants A Date For New Year&rsquo;s, never mind that he&rsquo;s a total stranger. They can get to know each other while they tongue to the ball-drop (the one in Times Square, Smutpot).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Duh: Of course Party Boy (and any boy) knows that seeing a girl PRE-New Year&rsquo;s puts on the pressure to ask her out FOR New Year&rsquo;s. And how would he worm his way out of that one?&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Speaking to KS&rsquo;s situation, look to Party Boy&rsquo;s behavior; no one here&rsquo;s shocked he&rsquo;s not chomping the bit to make plans. He didn&rsquo;t even want her phone number. Her having his was good enough. He&rsquo;d leave the rest to fate and chance.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Indeed, KS&rsquo;s Christmas party experience was rich with lessons for her and for the rest of us.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">When a guy gives you his contact information without asking for yours, don&rsquo;t brag.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">It says when it comes to seeing you again, he could take you or leave you.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">If he really wanted to nail it down, he&rsquo;d make sure to have your number stored before the night is over. You wouldn&rsquo;t be getting away so fast and easily, Missy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Specific to this time of year, if you meet a guy NOW (ie: right, like, immediately before New Year&rsquo;s) do not get all hung up on him asking you out for The Big Night. New Year&rsquo;s Eve is an overblown occasion, one with way too much stigma attached. Do not care. Really. If you do, use that same energy more productively and party for three days in a row with your best friends. Then share your fab stories. You come off as more interesting because you are.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Only time will tell if my sweet, love-ravenous, earnestly optimistic friend KS is getting the classic, holiday fade-out and will be forgotten, or if Party Boy will make good and make plans in 2012.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">To be continued.

Did you get in the water today?</p>\r\n<p>G: No, was a little too cold today and have been working on our next album when not working. But damn, can&rsquo;t wait for next summer. Nothing like being on the beach on a hot summer day, catching waves.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Would you say surfing is your passion?</p>\r\n<p>G: Absolutely. Growing up in the small, cool city of Sao Leopoldo in Southern Brazil, surfing was an institution. &nbsp;And surfing in NYC led to my work with HARDCORE.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CS: Oh yeah, the article about surfing in NYC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>G: Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Congrats! So, how long have you been in NYC?</p>\r\n<p>G: Just about half my life. 21 years.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Which is about the average age of most of the chicks I see you with?

So, why did you move up?</p>\r\n<p>G: The culture, I always loved the music, the skateboarding and surfing scene, so when my ex girlfriend moved here, it was a perfect excuse to come and check it out. I have been able to explore all my passions in this beautiful city.</p>\r\n<p>CS: What is your best surfing story?</p>\r\n<p>G: You know, I have so many surfing stories, but my favorite one actually happened in my hometown. I was out surfing on a picture perfect day. Glassy 6 footers, long periods, just catching waves all day. And then on my last wave, I dropped into the barrel only to see dolphins swimming parallel to my board. As I cut, so did they. Amazing.</p>\r\n<p>CS: Wow. So beautiful. So, talk to us about your band and drumming career.</p>\r\n<p>G: Well, that is the only thing that keeps me out of the water.

So, changing gears, what are you looking for in a woman, how do you define perfection?</p>\r\n<p>G: The perfect woman in my eyes, have to have style, and good looks as well, but what I love most is humor, adventure, a girl that loves music and knows how to dance. Someone you can have a fun conversation that lasts into the night.</p>\r\n<p>CS: So, besides having great hair, being a talented drummer, good surfer and skater, what do you have to offer?</p>\r\n<p>G: Ah, thanks man.

If you adopt proper form, whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced exerciser, you will achieve a higher success rate at a faster rate.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">If you\'ve seen a performer in Cirque de Soleil, you understand how form plays a tremendous part in their success! If these incredible performers did not exercise with proper form, their routines would be greatly compromised, or better yet, they wouldn\'t have a routine.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Given what they do, there can be no weak links in their execution of exercises. They understand how all of their muscles work in synergy&mdash;biceps don\'t work without triceps, and backs don&rsquo;t work without chests, etc.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Another important component of good form is full range of motion. Knowing your range of motion means knowing a little something about biomechanics, body positioning, and how your core and stabilizers are always working.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">And what about stretching? It is more than touching your toes!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">What are the benefits of good form? When it comes to aesthetics, full range of motion will shape (or reshape) your muscles. It is also one of the ways to actively stretch your muscles.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The benefits of this change in your form starts with the&nbsp;strengthening of&nbsp;your tendons, your ligaments, and the tissue that covers and protects the muscles at their insertion points, which is called&nbsp;<em>fascia</em>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">&ldquo;BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,&rdquo;&nbsp;you say. &ldquo;How will that get me a six pack?&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Well, first remember:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">THE MORE MUSCLE YOU INCORPORATE WHEN DOING ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES MOTION, THE MORE CALORIES YOU WILL BURN. IF YOU FOLLOW THE NUTRITIONAL ADVICE GIVEN IN MY COLUMN, THE MORE<em>&nbsp;</em><strong>FAT</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>YOU WILL BURN!!!

In most modeling ads, the models are usually posed in some type of position where you can see the streamline length of the torso leading to the chiseled sectioning of the abs. These images go across the board,&nbsp;male and female. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Women don\'t want muffin tops, and guys don&rsquo;t want spare tires and beer bellies. Sure, you do have some special people who are attracted to a nice big belly to keep them warm, but overall, we all can appreciate a nice firm mid-section.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">That said, here\'s more about me:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">As of this writing, I am 46-years-old (doesn\'t feel like it!). I have been a certified trainer and massage therapist for 18 years, and in those 18 years, the recurring theme that has made me a successful trainer and helped my clients reach their goals&nbsp;is understanding&nbsp;that&nbsp;<strong>food and form are everything</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">One thing that will be extremely important for you to recognize in following this&nbsp;post toward getting a tight, defined core is that getting abs isn&rsquo;t just&nbsp;about doing abs. This is just one of the many myths.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Another big myth is about eating. Some people assume they can eat anything that&nbsp;they want and&nbsp;do cardio&nbsp;like crazy and lose body fat and get the results that they want. What usually happens is those people lose weight that is primarily muscle and they tend too look gaunt and drawn in appearance. It\'s also about living a nutritionally healthy lifestyle.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Bruce Lee once said, \"Be water, my friend.\" What he went on to explain in that statement was that water is without form, it conforms to the shape of whatever contains it, it adapts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">That\'s deep!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">This was the idea behind his self-created martial art, jeet kune do. He basically took a combination of martial-art disciplines and melded them so that he was not beholden to&nbsp;one style. But to master being \"formless,\" he had to master many different weight-training exercises to&nbsp;give him the powerful, explosive, flexible body we all admired.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Going forward, remember these three words: STABILIZE, STABILIZERS and STABILIZING.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Your stabilizing muscles are the smaller muscles that lock your body in position while you are doing a specific movement; for example, when you are doing a standing barbell curl, you have to first position your body so that you are not going to cause injury by&nbsp;compromising your lower back, your shoulders or anything in-between! </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Once you adopt my techniques you will be on your way towards learning those techniques and building your dream physique!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','supertrainerrick','2012-02-13 22:03:20','2012-02-13 22:09:49',4,'exercise.jpg','image/jpeg',16869,'2012-02-13 22:09:25',0,'2012-02-13 22:09:49',1,'8pack','8pack'),(227,'#9 Pre-Game Song: Pitbull with Chris Brown','<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Song: International Love</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Why?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">It&rsquo;s impossible to sit still, or walk without some sort of pop in your step.

His email the next day wished me the best of health, and how was I doing? Remember: citrus and ginger tea, just like he advised me in the cab!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Date Two followed up to our date the next day with a sweet email&mdash;which applauded me for \"being such a trooper\" coming out with the flu, that he hopes I get better soon, and that he is sure I will be feeling much, much healthier the next time he sees me. This was after he joked (twice) while dropping me off that perhaps I was saying I was fluish so I would not have to kiss him goodnight.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Both boys are coming from the kindest and most caring place.

They see a guy with sticks, and wonder if he had been wheelchair-bound to achieve such minimal proportions&mdash;and trust me, they are looking at our butts just as much as we look at theirs! (I\'ll get to your butts later, ladies.)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The next reason is performance-based. Your legs consist of your&nbsp;quadriceps (front of your thigh), your calves, hamstrings (back of your thigh), and the largest muscle in the body, the gluteus, or your butt.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">All of these muscles work together to basically stand you up and sit you down, and everything in-between, such as running, jumping and every other lower-body motion.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Let&rsquo;s go over the basic leg movements that use all of those muscles, always with the focus on 1. legs, and 2. how they will work your core to put you on your way to an<strong> </strong>eight-pack<strong>.</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Now: To the ladies.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Just as I tell guys that there no \"girl\" exercises, I tell women that the exercises that&nbsp;they thought of as &ldquo;guy&rdquo; exercises are the same ones that are going to strengthen, lengthen,&nbsp;and tone their legs, butt and calves. The myth that their legs will get big comes from&nbsp;the&nbsp;body making muscle faster than it starts&nbsp;losing body fat, and the legs seem to get bigger until the metabolism kicks in and body fat gets used.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The myth of the girl exercises comes from some of the old school \"isolation&rdquo; exercises like inner thigh and butt movements, but they are made more effective when done in conjunction with other exercises that incorporate those muscles with a full range of motion.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">SQUATS</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Squats are as important for your legs as water is to plants.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">They involve all of the major muscles in the lower leg, yet most guys don\'t do them, and women usually think of them as a guy&rsquo;s exercise, or an exercise that will make their thighs big. This might be true if you\'re constantly lifting heavy weight, and eating enough calories to make that happen. That wouldn\'t happen overnight, so don&rsquo;t worry.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Another big reason why men and women don\'t do squats is because of&nbsp;back or knee problems, and/or a fear of causing back or knee problems; but standing up and sitting down are things that we do every day&mdash;basically a squat. Over the years, I have helped many a knee problem by simply correcting squat form.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> At the top of the movement, you are at an angle. Your feet are positioned slightly in front of your hips, so you are essentially&nbsp;leaning back so that as you descend, you are pushing your butt back as if you are sitting into a chair, bending at the waist and knees at the same time so that your shoulders stay in line with your hips, and your knees stay in line with your ankles, which helps you push through your heels, helping to engage the hips and not only the thighs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">This is important because a lot of knee issues occur from the quads being too tight or too&nbsp;strong, and the hamstrings too weak,&nbsp;which pulls awkwardly on the kneecap, often inflaming the joint, or the surrounding muscles.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Make sure as you make the transition&nbsp;ascending to&nbsp;put more focus on pushing through your heels. This&nbsp;mechanically tells your glutes and hamstrings to help your thighs in the process of standing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">FINISHING TIPS</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Keep your chest up nice and high to exaggerate the natural arch in the back. It tells the muscles along your spine to support you and your abs. This means your core is working. </span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> As you come up out of the squat while pushing through the heels, put your brain in your butt and feel the engagement of your glutes. Don\'t worry: over time, the connection will become second nature.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">STRETCHES</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Another big issue when it comes to the legs is lack of flexibility, which will cause or exacerbate problems.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Lower-body issues tend to stem from three places: back, knee, and hip problems. All three can usually be helped and prevented by a few simple stretches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">First is the back. You have a muscle in front at the top of your thighs called the psoas, and you also have the hip flexors. These two muscles work to help to curl your hips up to your torso, and your torso to your hips. The psoas wraps around and attaches by your lower back; so if your thighs are tight, chances are the psoas will be tight, thereby putting pressure on the lower back.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Here are a few stretches that will address that issue.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> First, position yourself in a lunge position. Keep your torso very upright, lean your body far forward, toward the forward leg, while contracting the glutes on the opposite side. (This will help relax the muscle you&rsquo;re trying to stretch.) Do this slowly and deliberately; you want to feel the stretch at the bend of your waist, not just in the thighs. You can also take this stretch to the next level by putting the trailing leg&nbsp;laces side down on a bench, which will elevate your leg behind you, or if you are home, on the couch. Follow the same steps, and you will feel the stretch more deeply throughout your thigh. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, release it, and repeat it at least twice, or until you can feel you are not getting any more range. These will help to stretch your thighs hip flexors and psoas muscles, helping to relieve lower-back tightness and knee tightness.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Second is for your glutes, hips and lower back.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Have a seat on the edge of a bench, or chair. Sit as if you were going to cross your legs, but only rest the foot and ankle of one leg on top of the knee of the opposite leg. Chances are you are going to be really tight when you try this stretch. You will improve with consistency. Don\'t hold your breath and use the same hold/release technique as described in the first stretch.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Keep in mind that the exercises you will be doing are primarily active-stretch exercises, which means your development of your full range of motion will be stretching your muscles as you strengthen them.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','supertrainerrick','2012-03-26 21:36:31','2012-03-26 21:39:53',4,'26fit2date.jpg','image/jpeg',68284,'2012-03-26 21:36:30',0,'2012-03-26 21:39:53',1,'hotlegs','hotlegs'),(264,'Miami\'s Fashion Vice','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Ah, Miami Beach.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">We love your palm trees, your retro hotels, your beaches, and your mind-blowing shopping.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">So what is it exactly about the fashion trends popping in our favorite American getaway that leave us stumped, trying to puzzle how we can look as sexy-cool as its locals?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Props go to FashionIndie, who break it down for us.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Now we can rock the 305 wherever we are.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><a href=\"http://fashionindie.com/broadcast-miami-local-trends/\" target=\"_blank\">Rock the 305</a></span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /> <strong>e.b.k. lives, plays, and dates in new york. she has a thing for art deco.</strong></p>','fashionindie','2012-03-27 13:57:30','2012-03-27 14:00:00',2,'26fashion.jpg','image/jpeg',378470,'2012-03-27 13:57:29',0,'2012-03-27 14:00:00',1,'miami','miami'),(265,'Nipped: Un/Tuck The Shirt','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The big debate over when, how, and why you dudes should <a href=\"xmastails\" target=\"_blank\">un/tuck your shirts</a> generates a lot of conversation here at ConnectingSexes headquarters.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Our pals at Details magazine and your StyleGirlfriend agreed the matter was pretty simple: Shove the durn thing in, or look slovenly.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">But many of you protested too much.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Well, good news, fellas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Apparently, it&rsquo;s a fashion matter more mathematical and intricate than ever we could have imagined; so to our friends at Primer Magazine, heaps of thanks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">They revealed that depending on the length of the shirt, which should be neither too long nor too short, and should be the same length in the front and back (deep breath): it is actually a total fashion YES to leave the tails OUT.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">So, whip our your measuring tape (no, not that one, Bronco), follow their guidelines, and get casual.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">For the pictures of where your shirt-hem should fall in order to execute, take a look right here:</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><a href=\"http://www.primermagazine.com/2011/spend/style-qa-how-long-should-the-front-be-of-an-untucked-button-up-shirt/\" target=\"_blank\">How Low Should It Go?</a></span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /> <strong>e.b.k. lives, plays, and dates in new york. mea culpa. sort of.<strong></strong></strong></p>','stylegirlfriend','2012-03-27 15:07:22','2012-03-27 15:07:44',3,'26stylegf.jpg','image/jpeg',56599,'2012-03-27 15:07:22',0,'2012-03-27 15:07:44',1,'niptuck','niptuck'),(266,'Watching Me, Watching You','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Is your Breitling making you feel like you\'ve strapped a salad plate to your wrist?

My inbox filled with his witty emails. Daily. They were manly.

Talk about your New York story: Rivera went from working retail to an internship at </em>Complex<em> magazine before his impressive gig today&mdash;managing rising-star Harlem-born rap artist, Perrion.</em></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: medium;\">Connecting Sexes</strong><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">: So, Andrew, thank you for joining our Local Celebrity interview, brought to you by ConnectingSexes.com. Let\'s start off with, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>Andrew Rivera</strong>: New York City. It&rsquo;s the best city on Earth. I mean, I know I</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">haven&rsquo;t been to every other city on the planet, and I&rsquo;m sure if you&rsquo;re</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">not from New York, you&rsquo;re reading this and you&rsquo;re totally like, &ldquo;Typical</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">New Yorker arrogance!&rdquo; You&rsquo;re right, it is.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>CS</strong>: So you\'ve grown up near [rap artist] Perrion? </span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>AR</strong>: Yeah, I&rsquo;m from Harlem, 136th Street, west side. Some people don&rsquo;t</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">consider that Harlem, but it sure as fuck isn&rsquo;t the Heights, and I&rsquo;m</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">not calling it Morning Side Heights. That name is for Columbia University pitch/scout meetings. I&rsquo;ve never met another person who grew up in my neighborhood that&rsquo;s called it anything but Harlem, and somehow, everyone who isn&rsquo;t from here thinks it&rsquo;s something else.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>CS</strong>: How did you meet Perrion?</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>AR</strong>: I met Perry when he was a drummer for a band called 5 Cases of a</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Tragedy. It was like Screamo/Emo music. Perry was always the one of</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">the group who impressed me the most. The band was cool for me to see. It was a bunch of Hispanic kids playing rock and even just a few years ago. That was somewhat weird for dudes to grasp.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Anyway, Perry was dating this girl for like a week, and I ended up dating her for two years [Laughs.] We would go on to hate each other for years until we realized that we were destined to work with each other. I used to give this kid stink eye. Now I&rsquo;m shooting videos in France with him. C&rsquo;est la vie, hunh?</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>CS</strong>: How are you keeping Perrion front-and-center? Any shows we should look out for?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: medium;\">AR</strong><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">: We\'re currently working on putting together a set different shows in New York. Rather than do a bunch of shitty New York shows like a lot of up and coming artists, we try to do a few big shows every now and then. My main focus is always online presence, marketing and the music of course. Keep checking </span><a style=\"font-size: medium;\" href=\"http://www.highoffmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">highoffmusic.com</a><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: medium;\">CS</strong><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">: What do you consider your best accomplishments as a team?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>AR</strong>: Putting ourselves in a position where we can achieve the things that we have in such a short amount of time with only three people: Perrion, co-manager Olivia Newton-Atwell, and myself. A year ago, I was just listening to one of Perry&rsquo;s songs, but now he&rsquo;s got three projects done, his videos don&rsquo;t do less than 10,000 views&mdash;and dude, we have fans in Sweden. My personal favorite accomplishment is my parents saluting my work, but this first year has really been amazing.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>CS</strong>: What was your favorite performance thus far?</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>AR</strong>: It would have to be Atlanta. Perry opened up for A$AP Rocky, and at</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">one point, some haters started booing him. It felt like the longest moment of my life. It wasn&rsquo;t long at all, he would go on to rock the show, but for five seconds&hellip;man, my heart was in my throat. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe and it felt like hell. We weren&rsquo;t used to that at all. Perry did crowd-surfs in France and we were treated like rap stars, but Atlanta taught me so much in five seconds. I&rsquo;ll take an education over fun any day of the week, which is odd because I&rsquo;m a college dropout.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>CS</strong>: Dates. Advise. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>AR</strong>: I hate ordinary, boring mapped out dates. [They have] to be one of the most awkward things on the planet. Do what good Americans do, find a dressing room at some with your lady or flooz and get it goin\'. Nah, just kidding. I don\'t know, but fellas, of all ages, don\'t ever,&nbsp;<em>ever</em>,&nbsp;<strong><em>EVER</em></strong>&nbsp;take a girl to a movie on a first date. Forget the fact that that horse has been beaten to death: you can\'t talk at a movie. You can\'t get to know the girl, chances are the movie isn\'t worth your money, and from what I hear, the whole \"penis in the popcorn\" thing is illegal. Just chillin&rsquo; with a girl is how I roll.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: medium;\">CS</strong><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">: So most important question, </span><em style=\"font-size: medium;\">The Blueprint</em><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> or </span><em style=\"font-size: medium;\">Reasonable Doubt</em><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>AR</strong>: <em>The Blueprint</em>, no question. I know I put myself at risk for the backpackers and hip-hop heads who think they&rsquo;re better rap fans than</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> everyone because it&rsquo;s 2012 and they listen to KRS-One and EPMD over</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Drake and Wiz Khalifa, but that&rsquo;s bullshit. In my opinion, <em>The&nbsp;Blueprint</em> is the best album Jay-Z has done. It was the perfect moment</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">in his life and career. He achieved everything he wanted to when he</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">made <em>Reasonable Doubt</em>. Look at the album art of <em>Reasonable Doubt</em>. Does that look like some dirty-ass backpacker? No. Jay was chasing paper and luxury from Day One! Anyone who tells you different is an idiot.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Moving from that, the production is outrageous. You&rsquo;re talking about</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Just Blaze and Kanye West producing in their prime. You have Jay-Z</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> banging out club hits like &ldquo;H to the Izzo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Girls, Girls, Girls,&rdquo; and</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> street anthems like &ldquo;U Don&rsquo;t Know,&rdquo; &ldquo;Never Change,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heart of the</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">City.&rdquo; His raps were developed. His sound was incredible. The flow of</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">the album was amazing and come on, &ldquo;Renegade.&rdquo; Enough said.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Men lie, women lie, numbers don&rsquo;t. In a time when people actually</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> bought records, <em>The Blueprint</em> sold 426,000 copies on 9/11! &nbsp;Sure, Jay had elevated status because he had done well before, but I don&rsquo;t care about Michael Jordan&rsquo;s first year, I care about his prime.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>CS</strong>: I lied. This is the most important question: &ldquo;Why are you a Local Celebrity?&rdquo;</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>AR</strong>: Damn, that&rsquo;s hard to answer without sounding like an arrogant</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> douche. It&rsquo;s dope to be mentioned as a Local Celebrity, and it&rsquo;s</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> awesome to do interviews, but I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not there yet. I got</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> recognized by a kid in Starbucks, and in France at a meet and greet. That&rsquo;s cool. The other cool thing for me is how often people send me</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> their music, videos, and their other stuff and then ask me for my</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> opinion or ask me questions on how to push it. It honestly makes me</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> feel like I&rsquo;ve done something that someone wants to emulate and apply</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">it to their own career because Perry&rsquo;s career is doing well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>CS</strong>: Let&rsquo;s go over this whole thing. You have been to France; the</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Mixtape, From Paris With Love, was incredibly well received; in April,</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Perrion is headlining his own show at the Velvet Jones in Santa Barbara, and 42,000+ hits on the &ldquo;Fire Ant&rdquo; video. What is your next set of goals?</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> <strong>AR</strong>: Well, I&rsquo;m going to do what I do every night, Stefan: Try to take over</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">the world! I know that&rsquo;s a joke to a lot of people, but I interned at</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Complex Magazine for two years and those guys are really seizing the</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Internet daily. Over there they teach you all about numbers. Every</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> time someone clicks a Perrion song, video, link, etc. etc., it means</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">I&rsquo;m doing my job right. Going into this a year ago, Perry had about</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">500 fans on Facebook, barely any Twitter followers, no music videos,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">100 views on his songs, and no blog love. Now he&rsquo;s got almost 3,000</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Facebook fans, 1,800 Twitter followers, 42,000 views on a video,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">almost 200,000 total video views. We&rsquo;re getting on music blogs that</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">we&rsquo;ve always loved: Hypetrak, Earmilk, HipHopUpdate, The Masked</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Gorilla and Vibe To This. Clothing brands fuck with us; Mishka</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> included him in their 2012 Spring Look Book. This sounds like me</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">listing off my accomplishments, and you may think, &ldquo;Who gives a fuck about how many people like you on Facebook?!&rdquo; But numbers don&rsquo;t lie.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Giving a fuck about those numbers and figuring out ways to make them</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">multiply is what got me here. It&rsquo;s what got me to France, and it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to get us our first million, I promise.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> My next set of goals is to double up on anything I&rsquo;ve already done. Okay, we did 42,000 on &ldquo;Fire Ant;&rdquo; let&rsquo;s do 84,000 or more on &ldquo;Gettin&rsquo; It.&rdquo; We hit five big blogs with this video. Let&rsquo;s hit 10 big blogs with the next one. We got shows done in France? Let&rsquo;s get a</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: medium;\">European tour going.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">To some people, it sounds like a stretch, but damn, I didn&rsquo;t think I would be here now, so why not?

Coupled with the fact that it\'s plain-old boring for most, this type of cardio doesn\'t do much to raise your fitness level, which is essential to really lose and/or maintain body fat.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>Put Your Back Into It</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Too many times, I see people in the gym just walking on the treadmill without even using a hint of an incline. People, come on: You walk every day. Your body has pretty much adapted to this workload. If you are able to read a magazine, or even a big, awkward newspaper, THEN YOU&rsquo;RE NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Your body is an adaptive tool. If this were considered exercise, it would have to be an intensified version of that walk&mdash;such as a big pump of the arms, use of the incline, etc.,&nbsp;so that your body says, &ldquo;Hey, I\'m doing something a little tougher than usual; I&rsquo;d better burn more calories because I&rsquo;m working harder!&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">I often hear trainers speak of how unnecessary it is to do \"isolation\" movements, such as curls or triceps, lateral raises and similar exercises. They usually preach this because they are speaking about moves that have more metabolism-boosting qualities, such as dead lifts, squats, presses, etc.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">These exercises are called multi-joint exercises simply because, just as you might assume, it means that more than one joint is working; therefore, more than one muscle group works. With an exercise like curls, only one muscle is working mechanically. Interestingly, you need many more muscles to stabilize the body to perform just one curl. Once you adopt and master the form that it takes to properly stabilize the body, you will burn a lot more calories performing this \"simple\" exercise.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>Use Your Core, Use Your Mind</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">One thing that I consistently hear when people ask about working their core is, &ldquo;Which abominal exercises should I do?&rdquo; My answer is always a quick tutorial about how your body doesn\'t work WITHOUT using your core. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">One of my relatively-new clients who had given birth to a beautiful baby boy asked me what she could do to get her tight core back, because she was burdened by time constraints with the baby, was recovering from giving birth, and didn\'t have time to get back to training. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">I asked if she was feeling her back when using the baby Bjorn carrier. She said she did. I told her to remember how I taught her how to feel the abs contract as she exhaled when doing her exercises. She remembered, but said it was difficult getting in touch with them now because the abdominal wall was stretched and weakened. I told her to focus on the support that she is naturally getting from her abdominals, and not on the tightness in her back, which will make her brain forget about her abs for support. She also had to make sure that she was doing the necessary stretches for her back so that the tightness wouldn\'t take over the feeling she should have in her abdominals.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Miracle of miracles, it worked! In no time, she got back in touch with her abs and made them work the way that they were supposed to. She started feeling her core tighten up like the girdle that it\'s supposed to be.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>','supertrainerrick','2012-04-16 16:04:24','2012-04-16 16:14:34',4,'16fit2date.jpg','image/jpeg',993032,'2012-04-16 16:04:19',0,'2012-04-16 16:14:34',1,'nofakes','nofakes'),(277,'Gee, Your Feet Smell Terrific','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Your StyleGirlfriend is really into guys sporting the sockless look.
